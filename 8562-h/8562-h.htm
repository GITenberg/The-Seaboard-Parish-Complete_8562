    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. HOMILETIC.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dear Friends,&mdash;I am beginning a new book like an old sermon; but, as
      you know, I have been so accustomed to preach all my life, that whatever I
      say or write will more or less take the shape of a sermon; and if you had
      not by this time learned at least to bear with my oddities, you would not
      have wanted any more of my teaching. And, indeed, I did not think you
      would want any more. I thought I had bidden you farewell. But I am seated
      once again at my writing-table, to write for you&mdash;with a strange
      feeling, however, that I am in the heart of some curious, rather awful
      acoustic contrivance, by means of which the words which I have a habit of
      whispering over to myself as I write them, are heard aloud by multitudes
      of people whom I cannot see or hear. I will favour the fancy, that, by a
      sense of your presence, I may speak the more truly, as man to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let me, for a moment, suppose that I am your grandfather, and that you
      have all come to beg for a story; and that, therefore, as usually happens
      in such cases, I am sitting with a puzzled face, indicating a more puzzled
      mind. I know that there are a great many stories in the holes and corners
      of my brain; indeed, here is one, there is one, peeping out at me like a
      rabbit; but alas, like a rabbit, showing me almost at the same instant the
      tail-end of it, and vanishing with a contemptuous <i>thud</i> of its hind
      feet on the ground. For I must have suitable regard to the desires of my
      children. It is a fine thing to be able to give people what they want, if
      at the same time you can give them what you want. To give people what they
      want, would sometimes be to give them only dirt and poison. To give them
      what you want, might be to set before them something of which they could
      not eat a mouthful. What both you and I want, I am willing to think, is a
      dish of good wholesome venison. Now I suppose my children around me are
      neither young enough nor old enough to care about a fairy tale, go that
      will not do. What they want is, I believe, something that I know about&mdash;that
      has happened to myself. Well, I confess, that is the kind of thing I like
      best to hear anybody talk to me about. Let anyone tell me something that
      has happened to himself, especially if he will give me a peep into how his
      heart took it, as it sat in its own little room with the closed door, and
      that person will, so telling, absorb my attention: he has something true
      and genuine and valuable to communicate. They are mostly old people that
      can do so. Not that young people have nothing happen to them; but that
      only when they grow old, are they able to see things right, to disentangle
      confusions, and judge righteous judgment. Things which at the time
      appeared insignificant or wearisome, then give out the light that was in
      them, show their own truth, interest, and influence: they are far enough
      off to be seen. It is not when we are nearest to anything that we know
      best what it is. How I should like to write a story for old people! The
      young are always having stories written for them. Why should not the old
      people come in for a share? A story without a young person in it at all!
      Nobody under fifty admitted! It could hardly be a fairy tale, could it? Or
      a love story either? I am not so sure about that. The worst of it would
      be, however, that hardly a young person would read it. Now, we old people
      would not like that. We can read young people&rsquo;s books and enjoy them: they
      would not try to read old men&rsquo;s books or old women&rsquo;s books; they would be
      so sure of their being dry. My dear old brothers and sisters, we know
      better, do we not? We have nice old jokes, with no end of fun in them;
      only they cannot see the fun. We have strange tales, that we know to be
      true, and which look more and more marvellous every time we turn them over
      again; only somehow they do not belong to the ways of this year&mdash;I
      was going to say <i>week</i>,&mdash;and so the young people generally do
      not care to hear them. I have had one pale-faced boy, to be sure, who will
      sit at his mother&rsquo;s feet, and listen for hours to what took place before
      he was born. To him his mother&rsquo;s wedding-gown was as old as Eve&rsquo;s coat of
      skins. But then he was young enough not yet to have had a chance of losing
      the childhood common to the young and the old. Ah! I should like to write
      for you, old men, old women, to help you to read the past, to help you to
      look for the future. Now is your salvation nearer than when you believed;
      for, however your souls may be at peace, however your quietness and
      confidence may give you strength, in the decay of your earthly tabernacle,
      in the shortening of its cords, in the weakening of its stakes, in the
      rents through which you see the stars, you have yet your share in the cry
      of the creation after the sonship. But the one thing I should keep saying
      to you, my companions in old age, would be, &ldquo;Friends, let us not grow
      old.&rdquo; Old age is but a mask; let us not call the mask the face. Is the
      acorn old, because its cup dries and drops it from its hold&mdash;because
      its skin has grown brown and cracks in the earth? Then only is a man
      growing old when he ceases to have sympathy with the young. That is a sign
      that his heart has begun to wither. And that is a dreadful kind of old
      age. The heart needs never be old. Indeed it should always be growing
      younger. Some of us feel younger, do we not, than when we were nine or
      ten? It is not necessary to be able to play at leapfrog to enjoy the game.
      There are young creatures whose turn it is, and perhaps whose duty it
      would be, to play at leap-frog if there was any necessity for putting the
      matter in that light; and for us, we have the privilege, or if we will not
      accept the privilege, then I say we have the duty, of enjoying their
      leap-frog. But if we must withdraw in a measure from sociable relations
      with our fellows, let it be as the wise creatures that creep aside and
      wrap themselves up and lay themselves by that their wings may grow and put
      on the lovely hues of their coming resurrection. Such a withdrawing is in
      the name of youth. And while it is pleasant&mdash;no one knows how
      pleasant except him who experiences it&mdash;to sit apart and see the
      drama of life going on around him, while his feelings are calm and free,
      his vision clear, and his judgment righteous, the old man must ever be
      ready, should the sweep of action catch him in its skirts, to get on his
      tottering old legs, and go with brave heart to do the work of a true man,
      none the less true that his hands tremble, and that he would gladly return
      to his chimney-corner. If he is never thus called out, let him examine
      himself, lest he should be falling into the number of those that say, &ldquo;I
      go, sir,&rdquo; and go not; who are content with thinking beautiful things in an
      Atlantis, Oceana, Arcadia, or what it may be, but put not forth one of
      their fingers to work a salvation in the earth. Better than such is the
      man who, using just weights and a true balance, sells good flour, and
      never has a thought of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been talking&mdash;to my reader is it? or to my supposed group of
      grandchildren? I remember&mdash;to my companions in old age. It is time I
      returned to the company who are hearing my whispers at the other side of
      the great thundering gallery. I take leave of my old friends with one
      word: We have yet a work to do, my friends; but a work we shall never do
      aright after ceasing to understand the new generation. We are not the men,
      neither shall wisdom die with us. The Lord hath not forsaken his people
      because the young ones do not think just as the old ones choose. The Lord
      has something fresh to tell them, and is getting them ready to receive his
      message. When we are out of sympathy with the young, then I think our work
      in this world is over. It might end more honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, readers in general, I have had time to consider what to tell you
      about, and how to begin. My story will be rather about my family than
      myself now. I was as it were a little withdrawn, even by the time of which
      I am about to write. I had settled into a gray-haired, quite elderly, yet
      active man&mdash;young still, in fact, to what I am now. But even then,
      though my faith had grown stronger, life had grown sadder, and needed all
      my stronger faith; for the vanishing of beloved faces, and the trials of
      them that are dear, will make even those that look for a better country
      both for themselves and their friends, sad, though it will be with a
      preponderance of the first meaning of the word <i>sad</i>, which was <i>settled</i>,
      <i>thoughtful</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am again seated in the little octagonal room, which I have made my study
      because I like it best. It is rather a shame, for my books cover over
      every foot of the old oak panelling. But they make the room all the
      pleasanter to the eye, and after I am gone, there is the old oak, none the
      worse, for anyone who prefers it to books.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend to use as the central portion of my present narrative the history
      of a year during part of which I took charge of a friend&rsquo;s parish, while
      my brother-in-law, Thomas Weir, who was and is still my curate, took the
      entire charge of Marshmallows. What led to this will soon appear. I will
      try to be minute enough in my narrative to make my story interesting,
      although it will cost me suffering to recall some of the incidents I have
      to narrate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. CONSTANCE&rsquo;S BIRTHDAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Was it from observation of nature in its association with human nature, or
      from artistic feeling alone, that Shakspere so often represents Nature&rsquo;s
      mood as in harmony with the mood of the principal actors in his drama? I
      know I have so often found Nature&rsquo;s mood in harmony with my own, even when
      she had nothing to do with forming mine, that in looking back I have
      wondered at the fact. There may, however, be some self-deception about it.
      At all events, on the morning of my Constance&rsquo;s eighteenth birthday, a
      lovely October day with a golden east, clouds of golden foliage about the
      ways, and an air that seemed filled with the ether of an <i>aurum potabile</i>,
      there came yet an occasional blast of wind, which, without being
      absolutely cold, smelt of winter, and made one draw one&rsquo;s shoulders
      together with the sense of an unfriendly presence. I do not think
      Constance felt it at all, however, as she stood on the steps in her
      riding-habit, waiting till the horses made their appearance. It had
      somehow grown into a custom with us that each of the children, as his or
      her birthday came round, should be king or queen for that day, and,
      subject to the veto of father and mother, should have everything his or
      her own way. Let me say for them, however, that in the matter of choosing
      the dinner, which of course was included in the royal prerogative, I came
      to see that it was almost invariably the favourite dishes of others of the
      family that were chosen, and not those especially agreeable to the royal
      palate. Members of families where children have not been taught from their
      earliest years that the great privilege of possession is the right to
      bestow, may regard this as an improbable assertion; but others will know
      that it might well enough be true, even if I did not say that so it was.
      But there was always the choice of some individual treat, which was
      determined solely by the preference of the individual in authority.
      Constance had chosen &ldquo;a long ride with papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose a parent may sometimes be right when he speaks with admiration
      of his own children. The probability of his being correct is to be
      determined by the amount of capacity he has for admiring other people&rsquo;s
      children. However this may be in my own case, I venture to assert that
      Constance did look very lovely that morning. She was fresh as the young
      day: we were early people&mdash;breakfast and prayers were over, and it
      was nine o&rsquo;clock as she stood on the steps and I approached her from the
      lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa! isn&rsquo;t it jolly?&rdquo; she said merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very jolly indeed, my dear,&rdquo; I answered, delighted to hear the word from
      the lips of my gentle daughter. She very seldom used a slang word, and
      when she did, she used it like a lady. Shall I tell you what she was like?
      Ah! you could not see her as I saw her that morning if I did. I will,
      however, try to give you a general idea, just in order that you and I
      should not be picturing to ourselves two very different persons while I
      speak of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was rather little, and so slight that she looked tall. I have often
      observed that the impression of height is an affair of proportion, and has
      nothing to do with feet and inches. She was rather fair in complexion,
      with her mother&rsquo;s blue eyes, and her mother&rsquo;s long dark wavy hair. She was
      generally playful, and took greater liberties with me than any of the
      others; only with her liberties, as with her slang, she knew instinctively
      when, where, and how much. For on the borders of her playfulness there
      seemed ever to hang a fringe of thoughtfulness, as if she felt that the
      present moment owed all its sparkle and brilliance to the eternal
      sunlight. And the appearance was not in the least a deceptive one. The
      eternal was not far from her&mdash;none the farther that she enjoyed life
      like a bird, that her laugh was merry, that her heart was careless, and
      that her voice rang through the house&mdash;a sweet soprano voice&mdash;singing
      snatches of songs (now a street tune she had caught from a London organ,
      now an air from Handel or Mozart), or that she would sometimes tease her
      elder sister about her solemn and anxious looks; for Wynnie, the eldest,
      had to suffer for her grandmother&rsquo;s sins against her daughter, and came
      into the world with a troubled little heart, that was soon compelled to
      flee for refuge to the rock that was higher than she. Ah! my Constance!
      But God was good to you and to us in you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where shall we go, Connie?&rdquo; I said, and the same moment the sound of the
      horses&rsquo; hoofs reached us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be too far to go to Addicehead?&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long ride,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much for the pony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear, no&mdash;not at all. I was thinking of you, not of the pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite as able to ride as the pony is to carry me, papa. And I want to
      get something for Wynnie. Do let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; I said, and raised her to the saddle&mdash;if I may
      say <i>raised</i>, for no bird ever hopped more lightly from one twig to
      another than she sprung from the ground on her pony&rsquo;s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment I was beside her, and away we rode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows were still long, the dew still pearly on the spiders&rsquo; webs, as
      we trotted out of our own grounds into a lane that led away towards the
      high road. Our horses were fresh and the air was exciting; so we turned
      from the hard road into the first suitable field, and had a gallop to
      begin with. Constance was a good horse-woman, for she had been used to the
      saddle longer than she could remember. She was now riding a tall well-bred
      pony, with plenty of life&mdash;rather too much, I sometimes thought, when
      I was out with Wynnie; but I never thought so when I was with Constance.
      Another field or two sufficiently quieted both animals&mdash;I did not
      want to have all our time taken up with their frolics&mdash;and then we
      began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are getting quite a woman now, Connie, my dear,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite an old grannie, papa,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old enough to think about what&rsquo;s coming next,&rdquo; I said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa! And you are always telling us that we must not think about the
      morrow, or even the next hour. But, then, that&rsquo;s in the pulpit,&rdquo; she
      added, with a sly look up at me from under the drooping feather of her
      pretty hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well what I mean, you puss,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t say
      one thing in the pulpit and another out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was at my horse&rsquo;s shoulder with a bound, as if Spry, her pony, had
      been of one mind and one piece with her. She was afraid she had offended
      me. She looked up into mine with as anxious a face as ever I saw upon
      Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, thank you, papa!&rdquo; she said when I smiled. &ldquo;I thought I had been rude.
      I didn&rsquo;t mean it, indeed I didn&rsquo;t. But I do wish you would make it a
      little plainer to me. I do think about things sometimes, though you would
      hardly believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want made plainer, my child?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re to think, and when we&rsquo;re not to think,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember all of this conversation because of what came so soon after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the known duty of to-morrow depends on the work of to-day,&rdquo; I
      answered, &ldquo;if it cannot be done right except you think about it and lay
      your plans for it, then that thought is to-day&rsquo;s business, not
      to-morrow&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear papa, some of your explanations are more difficult than the things
      themselves. May I be as impertinent as I like on my birthday?&rdquo; she asked
      suddenly, again looking up in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were walking now, and she had a hold of my horse&rsquo;s mane, so as to keep
      her pony close up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, as impertinent as you like&mdash;not an atom more, mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa, I sometimes wish you wouldn&rsquo;t explain things so much. I seem
      to understand you all the time you are preaching, but when I try the text
      afterwards by myself, I can&rsquo;t make anything of it, and I&rsquo;ve forgotten
      every word you said about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is because you have no right to understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought all Protestants had a right to understand every word of the
      Bible,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they can,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;But last Sunday, for instance, I did not
      expect anybody there to understand a certain bit of my sermon, except your
      mamma and Thomas Weir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny! What part of it was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! I&rsquo;m not going to tell you. You have no right to understand it. But
      most likely you thought you understood it perfectly, and it appeared to
      you, in consequence, very commonplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consequence of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consequence of your thinking you understood it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa dear! you&rsquo;re getting worse and worse. It&rsquo;s not often I ask you
      anything&mdash;and on my birthday too! It is really too bad of you to
      bewilder my poor little brains in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try to make you see what I mean, my pet. No talk about an idea
      that you never had in your head at all, can make you have that idea. If
      you had never seen a horse, no description even, not to say no amount of
      remark, would bring the figure of a horse before your mind. Much more is
      this the case with truths that belong to the convictions and feelings of
      the heart. Suppose a man had never in his life asked God for anything, or
      thanked God for anything, would his opinion as to what David meant in one
      of his worshipping psalms be worth much? The whole thing would be beyond
      him. If you have never known what it is to have care of any kind upon you,
      you cannot understand what our Lord means when he tells us to take no
      thought for the morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But indeed, papa, I am very full of care sometimes, though not perhaps
      about to-morrow precisely. But that does not matter, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. Tell me what you are full of care about, my child, and
      perhaps I can help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You often say, papa, that half the misery in this world comes from
      idleness, and that you do not believe that in a world where God is at work
      every day, Sundays not excepted, it could have been intended that women
      any more than men should have nothing to do. Now what am I to do? What
      have I been sent into the world for? I don&rsquo;t see it; and I feel very
      useless and wrong sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think there is very much to complain of you in that respect,
      Connie. You, and your sister as well, help me very much in my parish. You
      take much off your mother&rsquo;s hands too. And you do a good deal for the
      poor. You teach your younger brothers and sister, and meantime you are
      learning yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s not work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is work. And it is the work that is given you to do at present. And
      you would do it much better if you were to look at it in that light. Not
      that I have anything to complain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to stop at home and lead an easy, comfortable life, when
      there are so many to help everywhere in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything better in doing something where God has not placed you,
      than in doing it where he has placed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa. But my sisters are quite enough for all you have for us to do
      at home. Is nobody ever to go away to find the work meant for her? You
      won&rsquo;t think, dear papa, that I want to get away from home, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear. I believe that you are really thinking about duty. And now
      comes the moment for considering the passage to which you began by
      referring:&mdash;What God may hereafter require of you, you must not give
      yourself the least trouble about. Everything he gives you to do, you must
      do as well as ever you can, and that is the best possible preparation for
      what he may want you to do next. If people would but do what they have to
      do, they would always find themselves ready for what came next. And I do
      not believe that those who follow this rule are ever left floundering on
      the sea-deserted sands of inaction, unable to find water enough to swim
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear papa. That&rsquo;s a little sermon all to myself, and I think I
      shall understand it even when I think about it afterwards. Now let&rsquo;s have
      a trot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing more I ought to speak about though, Connie. It is not
      your moral nature alone you ought to cultivate. You ought to make yourself
      as worth God&rsquo;s making as you possibly can. Now I am a little doubtful
      whether you keep up your studies at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her pretty shoulders playfully, looking up in my face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like dry things, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How do the grammars and history-books come to be
      written then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In talking to me, somehow, the child always put on a more childish tone
      than when she talked to anyone else. I am certain there was no affection
      in it, though. Indeed, how could she be affected with her fault-finding
      old father?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Those books are exceedingly interesting to the people that make them.
      Dry things are just things that you do not know enough about to care for
      them. And all you learn at school is next to nothing to what you have to
      learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must I do then?&rdquo; she asked with a sigh. &ldquo;Must I go all over my
      French Grammar again? O dear! I do hate it so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will tell me something you like, Connie, instead of something you
      don&rsquo;t like, I may be able to give you advice. Is there nothing you are
      fond of?&rdquo; I continued, finding that she remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything in particular&mdash;that is, I don&rsquo;t know anything
      in the way of school-work that I really liked. I don&rsquo;t mean that I didn&rsquo;t
      try to do what I had to do, for I did. There was just one thing I liked&mdash;the
      poetry we had to learn once a week. But I suppose gentlemen count that
      silly&mdash;don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, my dear, I would make that liking of yours the
      foundation of all your work. Besides, I think poetry the grandest thing
      God has given us&mdash;though perhaps you and I might not quite agree
      about what poetry was poetry enough to be counted an especial gift of God.
      Now, what poetry do you like best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hemans&rsquo;s, I think, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, very well, to begin with. &lsquo;There is,&rsquo; as Mr. Carlyle said to a
      friend of mine&mdash;&lsquo;There is a thin vein of true poetry in Mrs. Hemans.&rsquo; 
      But it is time you had done with thin things, however good they may be.
      Most people never get beyond spoon-meat&mdash;in this world, at least, and
      they expect nothing else in the world to come. I must take you in hand
      myself, and see what I can do for you. It is wretched to see capable
      enough creatures, all for want of a little guidance, bursting with
      admiration of what owes its principal charm to novelty of form, gained at
      the cost of expression and sense. Not that that applies to Mrs. Hemans.
      She is simple enough, only diluted to a degree. But I hold that whatever
      mental food you take should be just a little too strong for you. That
      implies trouble, necessitates growth, and involves delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t mind how difficult it is if you help me, papa. But it is
      anything but satisfactory to go groping on without knowing what you are
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ought to have mentioned that Constance had been at school for two years,
      and had only been home a month that very day, in order to account for my
      knowing so little about her tastes and habits of mind. We went on talking
      a little more in the same way, and if I were writing for young people
      only, I should be tempted to go on a little farther with the account of
      what we said to each other; for it might help some of them to see that the
      thing they like best should, circumstances and conscience permitting, be
      made the centre from which they start to learn; that they should go on
      enlarging their knowledge all round from that one point at which God
      intended them to begin. But at length we fell into a silence, a very happy
      one on my part; for I was more than delighted to find that this one too of
      my children was following after the truth&mdash;wanting to do what was
      right, namely, to obey the word of the Lord, whether openly spoken to all,
      or to herself in the voice of her own conscience and the light of that
      understanding which is the candle of the Lord. I had often said to myself
      in past years, when I had found myself in the company of young ladies who
      announced their opinions&mdash;probably of no deeper origin than the
      prejudices of their nurses&mdash;as if these distinguished them from all
      the world besides; who were profound upon passion and ignorant of grace;
      who had not a notion whether a dress was beautiful, but only whether it
      was of the newest cut&mdash;I had often said to myself: &ldquo;What shall I do
      if my daughters come to talk and think like that&mdash;if thinking it can
      be called?&rdquo; but being confident that instruction for which the mind is not
      prepared only lies in a rotting heap, producing all kinds of mental evils
      correspondent to the results of successive loads of food which the system
      cannot assimilate, my hope had been to rouse wise questions in the minds
      of my children, in place of overwhelming their digestions with what could
      be of no instruction or edification without the foregoing appetite. Now my
      Constance had begun to ask me questions, and it made me very happy. We had
      thus come a long way nearer to each other; for however near the affection
      of human animals may bring them, there are abysses between soul and soul&mdash;the
      souls even of father and daughter&mdash;over which they must pass to meet.
      And I do not believe that any two human beings alive know yet what it is
      to love as love is in the glorious will of the Father of lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      I linger on with my talk, for I shrink from what I must relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were going at a gentle trot, silent, along a woodland path&mdash;a
      brown, soft, shady road, nearly five miles from home, our horses
      scattering about the withered leaves that lay thick upon it. A good deal
      of underwood and a few large trees had been lately cleared from the place.
      There were many piles of fagots about, and a great log lying here and
      there along the side of the path. One of these, when a tree, had been
      struck by lightning, and had stood till the frosts and rains had bared it
      of its bark. Now it lay white as a skeleton by the side of the path, and
      was, I think, the cause of what followed. All at once my daughter&rsquo;s pony
      sprang to the other side of the road, shying sideways; unsettled her so, I
      presume; then rearing and plunging, threw her from the saddle across one
      of the logs of which I have spoken. I was by her side in a moment. To my
      horror she lay motionless. Her eyes were closed, and when I took her up in
      my arms she did not open them. I laid her on the moss, and got some water
      and sprinkled her face. Then she revived a little; but seemed in much
      pain, and all at once went off into another faint. I was in terrible
      perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a man who, having been cutting fagots at a little distance, had
      seen the pony careering through the wood, came up and asked what he could
      do to help me. I told him to take my horse, whose bridle I had thrown over
      the latch of a gate, and ride to Oldcastle Hall, and ask Mrs. Walton to
      come with the carriage as quickly as possible. &ldquo;Tell her,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that
      her daughter has had a fall from her pony, and is rather shaken. Ride as
      hard as you can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was off in a moment; and there I sat watching my poor child, for
      what seemed to be a dreadfully long time before the carriage arrived. She
      had come to herself quite, but complained of much pain in her back; and,
      to my distress, I found that she could not move herself enough to make the
      least change of her position. She evidently tried to keep up as well as
      she could; but her face expressed great suffering: it was dreadfully pale,
      and looked worn with a month&rsquo;s illness. All my fear was for her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I caught sight of the carriage, coming through the wood as fast
      as the road would allow, with the woodman on the box, directing the
      coachman. It drew up, and my wife got out. She was as pale as Constance,
      but quiet and firm, her features composed almost to determination. I had
      never seen her look like that before. She asked no questions: there was
      time enough for that afterwards. She had brought plenty of cushions and
      pillows, and we did all we could to make an easy couch for the poor girl;
      but she moaned dreadfully as we lifted her into the carriage. We did our
      best to keep her from being shaken; but those few miles were the longest
      journey I ever made in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached home at length, we found that Ethel, or, as we commonly
      called her, using the other end of her name, Wynnie&mdash;for she was
      named after her mother&mdash;had got a room on the ground-floor, usually
      given to visitors, ready for her sister; and we were glad indeed not to
      have to carry her up the stairs. Before my wife left, she had sent the
      groom off to Addicehead for both physician and surgeon. A young man who
      had settled at Marshmallows as general practitioner a year or two before,
      was waiting for us when we arrived. He helped us to lay her upon a
      mattress in the position in which she felt the least pain. But why should
      I linger over the sorrowful detail? All agreed that the poor child&rsquo;s spine
      was seriously injured, and that probably years of suffering were before
      her. Everything was done that could be done; but she was not moved from
      that room for nine months, during which, though her pain certainly grew
      less by degrees, her want of power to move herself remained almost the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had left her at last a little composed, with her mother seated by
      her bedside, I called my other two daughters&mdash;Wynnie, the eldest, and
      Dorothy, the youngest, whom I found seated on the floor outside, one on
      each side of the door, weeping&mdash;into my study, and said to them: &ldquo;My
      darlings, this is very sad; but you must remember that it is God&rsquo;s will;
      and as you would both try to bear it cheerfully if it had fallen to your
      lot to bear, you must try to be cheerful even when it is your sister&rsquo;s
      part to endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa! poor Connie!&rdquo; cried Dora, and burst into fresh tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie said nothing, but knelt down by my knee, and laid her cheek upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what Constance said to me just before I left the room?&rdquo;
       I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She whispered, &lsquo;You must try to bear it, all of you, as well as you can.
      I don&rsquo;t mind it very much, only for you.&rsquo; So, you see, if you want to make
      her comfortable, you must not look gloomy and troubled. Sick people like
      to see cheerful faces about them; and I am sure Connie will not suffer
      nearly so much if she finds that she does not make the household gloomy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I had learned from being ill myself once or twice since my marriage.
      My wife never came near me with a gloomy face, and I had found that it was
      quite possible to be sympathetic with those of my flock who were ill
      without putting on a long face when I went to see them. Of course, I do
      not mean that I could, or that it was desirable that I should, look
      cheerful when any were in great pain or mental distress. But in ordinary
      conditions of illness a cheerful countenance is as a message of <i>all&rsquo;s
      well</i>, which may surely be carried into a sick chamber by the man who
      believes that the heart of a loving Father is at the centre of things,
      that he is light all about the darkness, and that he will not only bring
      good out of evil at last, but will be with the sufferer all the time,
      making endurance possible, and pain tolerable. There are a thousand
      alleviations that people do not often think of, coming from God himself.
      Would you not say, for instance, that time must pass very slowly in pain?
      But have you never observed, or has no one ever made the remark to you,
      how strangely fast, even in severe pain, the time passes after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do all we can, will we not,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;to make her as
      comfortable as possible? You, Dora, must attend to your little brothers,
      that your mother may not have too much to think about now that she will
      have Connie to nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could not say much, but they both kissed me, and went away leaving me
      to understand clearly enough that they had quite understood me. I then
      returned to the sick chamber, where I found that the poor child had fallen
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife and I watched by her bedside on alternate nights, until the pain
      had so far subsided, and the fever was so far reduced, that we could allow
      Wynnie to take a share in the office. We could not think of giving her
      over to the care of any but one of ourselves during the night. Her chief
      suffering came from its being necessary that she should keep nearly one
      position on her back, because of her spine, while the external bruise and
      the swelling of the muscles were in consequence so painful, that it needed
      all that mechanical contrivance could do to render the position endurable.
      But these outward conditions were greatly ameliorated before many days
      were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a dreary beginning of my story, is it not? But sickness of all
      kinds is such a common thing in the world, that it is well sometimes to
      let our minds rest upon it, lest it should take us altogether at unawares,
      either in ourselves or our friends, when it comes. If it were not a good
      thing in the end, surely it would not be; and perhaps before I have done
      my readers will not be sorry that my tale began so gloomily. The sickness
      in Judaea eighteen hundred and thirty-five years ago, or thereabouts, has
      no small part in the story of him who came to put all things under our
      feet. Praise be to him for evermore!
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became evident to me that that room was like a new and more sacred
      heart to the house. At first it radiated gloom to the remotest corners;
      but soon rays of light began to appear mingling with the gloom. I could
      see that bits of news were carried from it to the servants in the kitchen,
      in the garden, in the stable, and over the way to the home-farm. Even in
      the village, and everywhere over the parish, I was received more kindly,
      and listened to more willingly, because of the trouble I and my family
      were in; while in the house, although we had never been anything else than
      a loving family, it was easy to discover that we all drew more closely
      together in consequence of our common anxiety. Previous to this, it had
      been no unusual thing to see Wynnie and Dora impatient with each other;
      for Dora was none the less a wild, somewhat lawless child, that she was a
      profoundly affectionate one. She rather resembled her cousin Judy, in fact&mdash;whom
      she called Aunt Judy, and with whom she was naturally a great favourite.
      Wynnie, on the other hand, was sedate, and rather severe&mdash;more
      severe, I must in justice say, with herself than with anyone else. I had
      sometimes wished, it is true, that her mother, in regard to the younger
      children, were more like her; but there I was wrong. For one of the great
      goods that come of having two parents, is that the one balances and
      rectifies the motions of the other. No one is good but God. No one holds
      the truth, or can hold it, in one and the same thought, but God. Our human
      life is often, at best, but an oscillation between the extremes which
      together make the truth; and it is not a bad thing in a family, that the
      pendulums of father and mother should differ in movement so far, that when
      the one is at one extremity of the swing, the other should be at the
      other, so that they meet only in the point of <i>indifference</i>, in the
      middle; that the predominant tendency of the one should not be the
      predominant tendency of the other. I was a very strict disciplinarian&mdash;too
      much so, perhaps, sometimes: Ethelwyn, on the other hand, was too much
      inclined, I thought, to excuse everything. I was law, she was grace. But
      grace often yielded to law, and law sometimes yielded to grace. Yet she
      represented the higher; for in the ultimate triumph of grace, in the glad
      performance of the command from love of what is commanded, the law is
      fulfilled: the law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. I must say
      this for myself, however, that, although obedience was the one thing I
      enforced, believing it the one thing upon which all family economy
      primarily depends, yet my object always was to set my children free from
      my law as soon as possible; in a word, to help them to become, as soon as
      it might be, a law unto themselves. Then they would need no more of mine.
      Then I would go entirely over to the mother&rsquo;s higher side, and become to
      them, as much as in me lay, no longer law and truth, but grace and truth.
      But to return to my children&mdash;it was soon evident not only that
      Wynnie had grown more indulgent to Dora&rsquo;s vagaries, but that Dora was more
      submissive to Wynnie, while the younger children began to obey their
      eldest sister with a willing obedience, keeping down their effervescence
      within doors, and letting it off only out of doors, or in the out-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Constance began to recover a little, then the sacredness of that
      chamber began to show itself more powerfully, radiating on all sides a yet
      stronger influence of peace and goodwill. It was like a fountain of gentle
      light, quieting and bringing more or less into tune all that came within
      the circle of its sweetness. This brings me to speak again of my lovely
      child. For surely a father may speak thus of a child of God. He cannot
      regard his child as his even as a book he has written may be his. A man&rsquo;s
      child is his because God has said to him, &ldquo;Take this child and nurse it
      for me.&rdquo; She is God&rsquo;s making; God&rsquo;s marvellous invention, to be tended and
      cared for, and ministered unto as one of his precious things; a young
      angel, let me say, who needs the air of this lower world to make her wings
      grow. And while he regards her thus, he will see all other children in the
      same light, and will not dare to set up his own against others of God&rsquo;s
      brood with the new-budding wings. The universal heart of truth will thus
      rectify, while it intensifies, the individual feeling towards one&rsquo;s own;
      and the man who is most free from poor partisanship in regard to his own
      family, will feel the most individual tenderness for the lovely human
      creatures whom God has given into his own especial care and
      responsibility. Show me the man who is tender, reverential, gracious
      towards the children of other men, and I will show you the man who will
      love and tend his own best, to whose heart his own will flee for their
      first refuge after God, when they catch sight of the cloud in the wind.

      CHAPTER III. THE SICK CHAMBER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the course of a month there was a good deal more of light in the smile
      with which my darling greeted me when I entered her room in the morning.
      Her pain was greatly gone, but the power of moving her limbs had not yet
      even begun to show itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she received me with a still happier smile than I had yet seen
      upon her face, put out her thin white hand, took mine and kissed it, and
      said, &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; with a lingering on the last syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my pet?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you so happy?&rdquo; I asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought about it yet. But
      everything looks so pleasant round me. Is it nearly winter yet, papa? I&rsquo;ve
      forgotten all about how the time has been going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is almost winter, my dear. There is hardly a leaf left on the trees&mdash;just
      two or three disconsolate yellow ones that want to get away down to the
      rest. They go fluttering and fluttering and trying to break away, but they
      can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just as I felt a little while ago. I wanted to die and get away,
      papa; for I thought I should never be well again, and I should be in
      everybody&rsquo;s way.&mdash;I am afraid I shall not get well, after all,&rdquo; she
      added, and the light clouded on her sweet face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my darling, we are in God&rsquo;s hands. We shall never get tired of you,
      and you must not get tired of us. Would you get tired of nursing me, if I
      were ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa!&rdquo; And the tears began to gather in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must think we are not able to love so well as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean. I did not think of it that way. I will never think
      so about it again. I was only thinking how useless I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are quite mistaken, my dear. No living creature ever was
      useless. You&rsquo;ve got plenty to do there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what have I got to do? I don&rsquo;t feel able for anything,&rdquo; she said; and
      again the tears came in her eyes, as if I had been telling her to get up
      and she could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal of our work,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;we do without knowing what it is.
      But I&rsquo;ll tell you what you have got to do: you have got to believe in God,
      and in everybody in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, I do. But that is easy to do,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think that the work God gives us to do is never easy? Jesus
      says his yoke is easy, his burden is light. People sometimes refuse to do
      God&rsquo;s work just because it is easy. This is, sometimes, because they
      cannot believe that easy work is his work; but there may be a very bad
      pride in it: it may be because they think that there is little or no
      honour to be got in that way; and therefore they despise it. Some again
      accept it with half a heart, and do it with half a hand. But, however easy
      any work may be, it cannot be well done without taking thought about it.
      And such people, instead of taking thought about their work, generally
      take thought about the morrow, in which no work can be done any more than
      in yesterday. The Holy Present!&mdash;I think I must make one more sermon
      about it&mdash;although you, Connie,&rdquo; I said, meaning it for a little
      joke, &ldquo;do think that I have said too much about it already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, papa! do forgive me. This is a judgment on me for talking to you as
      I did that dreadful morning. But I was so happy that I was impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly darling!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A judgment! God be angry with you for that!
      Even if it had been anything wrong, which it was not, do you think God has
      no patience? No, Connie. I will tell you what seems to me much more
      likely. You wanted something to do; and so God gave you something to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lying in bed and doing nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Just lying in bed, and doing his will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could but feel that I was doing his will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you do it, then you will feel you are doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are coming to something, papa. Please make haste, for my back
      is getting so bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tired you, my pet. It was very thoughtless of me. I will tell you
      the rest another time,&rdquo; I said, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. It will make me much worse not to hear it all now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will tell you. Be still, my darling, I won&rsquo;t be long. In the time
      of the old sacrifices, when God so kindly told his ignorant children to do
      something for him in that way, poor people were told to bring, not a
      bullock or a sheep, for that was more than they could get, but a pair of
      turtledoves, or two young pigeons. But now, as Crashaw the poet says,
      &lsquo;Ourselves become our own best sacrifice.&rsquo; God wanted to teach people to
      offer themselves. Now, you are poor, my pet, and you cannot offer yourself
      in great things done for your fellow-men, which was the way Jesus did. But
      you must remember that the two young pigeons of the poor were just as
      acceptable to God as the fat bullock of the rich. Therefore you must say
      to God something like this:&mdash;&lsquo;O heavenly Father, I have nothing to
      offer thee but my patience. I will bear thy will, and so offer my will a
      burnt-offering unto thee. I will be as useless as thou pleasest.&rsquo; Depend
      upon it, my darling, in the midst of all the science about the world and
      its ways, and all the ignorance of God and his greatness, the man or woman
      who can thus say, <i>Thy will be done</i>, with the true heart of giving
      up is nearer the secret of things than the geologist and theologian. And
      now, my darling, be quiet in God&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held up her mouth to kiss me, but did not speak, and I left her, and
      sent Dora to sit with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when I went into her room again, having been out in my
      parish all the morning, I began to unload my budget of small events.
      Indeed, we all came in like pelicans with stuffed pouches to empty them in
      her room, as if she had been the only young one we had, and we must cram
      her with news. Or, rather, she was like the queen of the commonwealth
      sending out her messages into all parts, and receiving messages in return.
      I might call her the brain of the house; but I have used similes enough
      for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I had done talking, she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have been to the school too, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I go to the school almost every day. I fancy in such a school as
      ours the young people get more good than they do in church. You know I had
      made a great change in the Sunday-school just before you came home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of that, papa. You won&rsquo;t let any of the little ones go to school
      on the Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is too much for them. And having made this change, I feel the
      necessity of being in the school myself nearly every day, that I may do
      something direct for the little ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll have to take me up soon, as you promised, you know, papa&mdash;just
      before Sprite threw me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you like, my dear, after you are able to read again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you must begin before that, please.&mdash;You could spare time to read
      a little to me, couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said doubtfully, as if she feared she
      was asking too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear; and I will begin to think about it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in part the result of this wish of my child&rsquo;s that it became the
      custom to gather in her room on Sunday evenings. She was quite unable for
      any kind of work such as she would have had me commence with her, but I
      used to take something to read to her every now and then, and always after
      our early tea on Sundays.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a thing it is to have one to speak and think about and try to find
      out and understand, who is always and altogether and perfectly good! Such
      a centre that is for all our thoughts and words and actions and
      imaginations! It is indeed blessed to be human beings with Jesus Christ
      for the centre of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the papers wherein I am about to record the chief events of the
      following years of my life, I shall give a short account of what passed at
      some of these assemblies in my child&rsquo;s room, in the hope that it may give
      my friends something, if not new, yet fresh to think about. For God has so
      made us that everyone who thinks at all thinks in a way that must be more
      or less fresh to everyone else who thinks, if he only have the gift of
      setting forth his thoughts so that we can see what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope my readers will not be alarmed at this, and suppose that I am about
      to inflict long sermons upon them. I am not. I do hope, as I say, to teach
      them something; but those whom I succeed in so teaching will share in the
      delight it will give me to write about what I love most.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as I can remember, I will tell how this Sunday-evening class began.
      I was sitting by Constance&rsquo;s bed. The fire was burning brightly, and the
      twilight had deepened so nearly into night that it was reflected back from
      the window, for the curtains had not yet been drawn. There was no light in
      the room but that of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Constance was in the way of asking often what kind of day or night it
      was, for there never was a girl more a child of nature than she. Her heart
      seemed to respond at once to any and every mood of the world around her.
      To her the condition of air, earth, and sky was news, and news of poetic
      interest too. &ldquo;What is it like?&rdquo; she would often say, without any more
      definite shaping of the question. This same evening she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it like, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is growing dark,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;as you can see. It is a still evening,
      and what they call a black frost. The trees are standing as still as if
      they were carved out of stone, and would snap off everywhere if the wind
      were to blow. The ground is dark, and as hard as if it were of cast iron.
      A gloomy night rather, my dear. It looks as if there were something upon
      its mind that made it sullenly thoughtful; but the stars are coming out
      one after another overhead, and the sky will be all awake soon. A strange
      thing the life that goes on all night, is it not? The life of owlets, and
      mice, and beasts of prey, and bats, and stars,&rdquo; I said, with no very
      categorical arrangement, &ldquo;and dreams, and flowers that don&rsquo;t go to sleep
      like the rest, but send out their scent all night long. Only those are
      gone now. There are no scents abroad, not even of the earth in such a
      frost as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it looks sometimes, papa, as if God turned his back on
      the world, or went farther away from it for a while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me a little more what you mean, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this night now, this dark, frozen, lifeless night, which you have
      been describing to me, isn&rsquo;t like God at all&mdash;is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not. I see what you mean now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just as if he had gone away and said, &lsquo;Now you shall see what you
      can do without me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something like that. But do you know that English people&mdash;at least I
      think so&mdash;enjoy the changeful weather of their country much more upon
      the whole than those who have fine weather constantly? You see it is not
      enough to satisfy God&rsquo;s goodness that he should give us all things richly
      to enjoy, but he must make us able to enjoy them as richly as he gives
      them. He has to consider not only the gift, but the receiver of the gift.
      He has to make us able to take the gift and make it our own, as well as to
      give us the gift. In fact, it is not real giving, with the full, that is,
      the divine, meaning of giving, without it. He has to give us to the gift
      as well as give the gift to us. Now for this, a break, an interruption is
      good, is invaluable, for then we begin to think about the thing, and do
      something in the matter ourselves. The wonder of God&rsquo;s teaching is that,
      in great part, he makes us not merely learn, but teach ourselves, and that
      is far grander than if he only made our minds as he makes our bodies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand you, papa. For since I have been ill, you would
      wonder, if you could see into me, how even what you tell me about the
      world out of doors gives me more pleasure than I think I ever had when I
      could go about in it just as I liked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do that, though, you know, if you hadn&rsquo;t had the other first.
      The pleasure you have comes as much from your memory as from my news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now can you tell me anything in history that confirms what I have been
      saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about history, papa. The only thing that comes into
      my head is what you were saying yourself the other day about Milton&rsquo;s
      blindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. I had not thought of that. Do you know, I do believe that God
      wanted a grand poem from that man, and therefore blinded him that he might
      be able to write it. But he had first trained him up to the point&mdash;given
      him thirty years in which he had not to provide the bread of a single day,
      only to learn and think; then set him to teach boys; then placed him at
      Cromwell&rsquo;s side, in the midst of the tumultuous movement of public
      affairs, into which the late student entered with all his heart and soul;
      and then last of all he cast the veil of a divine darkness over him, sent
      him into a chamber far more retired than that in which he laboured at
      Cambridge, and set him like the nightingale to sing darkling. The
      blackness about him was just the great canvas which God gave him to cover
      with forms of light and music. Deep wells of memory burst upwards from
      below; the windows of heaven were opened from above; from both rushed the
      deluge of song which flooded his soul, and which he has poured out in a
      great river to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather hard for poor Milton, though, wasn&rsquo;t it, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till he says so, my dear. We are sometimes too ready with our
      sympathy, and think things a great deal worse than those who have to
      undergo them. Who would not be glad to be struck with <i>such</i>
      blindness as Milton&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those that do not care about his poetry, papa,&rdquo; answered Constance, with
      a deprecatory smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well said, my Connie. And to such it never can come. But, if it please
      God, you will love Milton before you are about again. You can&rsquo;t love one
      you know nothing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to read him a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I daresay. You might as well talk of liking a man whose face you had
      never seen, because you did not approve of the back of his coat. But you
      and Milton together have led me away from a far grander instance of what
      we had been talking about. Are you tired, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least, papa. You don&rsquo;t mind what I said about Milton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear. I like your honesty. But I should mind very much if
      you thought, with your ignorance of Milton, that your judgment of him was
      more likely to be right than mine, with my knowledge of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa! I am only sorry that I am not capable of appreciating him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are wrong again. I think you are quite capable of appreciating
      him. But you cannot appreciate what you have never seen. You think of him
      as dry, and think you ought to be able to like dry things. Now he is not
      dry, and you ought not to be able to like dry things. You have a figure
      before you in your fancy, which is dry, and which you call Milton. But it
      is no more Milton than your dull-faced Dutch doll, which you called after
      her, was your merry Aunt Judy. But here comes your mamma; and I haven&rsquo;t
      said what I wanted to say yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, husband, you can say it all the same,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;I will
      go away if you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can say it all the better, my love. Come and sit down here beside me. I
      was trying to show Connie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did show me, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was showing Connie that a gift has sometimes to be taken away
      again before we can know what it is worth, and so receive it right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethelwyn sighed. She was always more open to the mournful than the glad.
      Her heart had been dreadfully wrung in her youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was going on to give her the greatest instance of it in human
      history. As long as our Lord was with his disciples, they could not see
      him right: he was too near them. Too much light, too many words, too much
      revelation, blinds or stupefies. The Lord had been with them long enough.
      They loved him dearly, and yet often forgot his words almost as soon as he
      said them. He could not get it into them, for instance, that he had not
      come to be a king. Whatever he said, they shaped it over again after their
      own fancy; and their minds were so full of their own worldly notions of
      grandeur and command, that they could not receive into their souls the
      gift of God present before their eyes. Therefore he was taken away, that
      his Spirit, which was more himself than his bodily presence, might come
      into them&mdash;that they might receive the gift of God into their
      innermost being. After he had gone out of their sight, and they might look
      all around and down in the grave and up in the air, and not see him
      anywhere&mdash;when they thought they had lost him, he began to come to
      them again from the other side&mdash;from the inside. They found that the
      image of him which his presence with them had printed in light upon their
      souls, began to revive in the dark of his absence; and not that only, but
      that in looking at it without the overwhelming of his bodily presence,
      lines and forms and meanings began to dawn out of it which they had never
      seen before. And his words came back to them, no longer as they had
      received them, but as he meant them. The spirit of Christ filling their
      hearts and giving them new power, made them remember, by making them able
      to understand, all that he had said to them. They were then always saying
      to each other, &lsquo;You remember how;&rsquo; whereas before, they had been always
      staring at each other with astonishment and something very near
      incredulity, while he spoke to them. So that after he had gone away, he
      was really nearer to them than he had been before. The meaning of anything
      is more than its visible presence. There is a soul in everything, and that
      soul is the meaning of it. The soul of the world and all its beauty has
      come nearer to you, my dear, just because you are separated from it for a
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear papa. I do like to get a little sermon all to myself now
      and then. That is another good of being ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean me to have a share in it, then, Connie, do you?&rdquo; said my
      wife, smiling at her daughter&rsquo;s pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, mamma! I should have thought you knew all papa had got to say by this
      time. I daresay he has given you a thousand sermons all to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you suppose, Connie, that I came into the world with just a boxful
      of sermons, and after I had taken them all out there were no more. I
      should be sorry to think I should not have a good many new things to say
      by this time next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa, I wish I could be sure of knowing more next year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most people do learn, whether they will or not. But the kind of learning
      is very different in the two cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to ask you one question, papa: do you think that we should not
      know Jesus better now if he were to come and let us see him&mdash;as he
      came to the disciples so long, long ago? I wish it were not so long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the time, it makes no difference whether it was last year or two
      thousand years ago. The whole question is how much we understand, and
      understanding, obey him. And I do not think we should be any nearer that
      if he came amongst us bodily again. If we should, he would come. I believe
      we should be further off it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, then,&rdquo; said Connie, in an almost despairing tone, as if I
      were the prophet of great evil, &ldquo;that we shall never, never, never see
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is <i>quite</i> another thing, my Connie. That is the heart of my
      hopes by day and my dreams by night. To behold the face of Jesus seems to
      me the one thing to be desired. I do not know that it is to be prayed for;
      but I think it will be given us as the great bounty of God, so soon as
      ever we are capable of it. That sight of the face of Jesus is, I think,
      what is meant by his glorious appearing, but it will come as a consequence
      of his spirit in us, not as a cause of that spirit in us. The pure in
      heart shall see God. The seeing of him will be the sign that we are like
      him, for only by being like him can we see him as he is. All the time that
      he was with them, the disciples never saw him as he was. You must
      understand a man before you can see and read his face aright; and as the
      disciples did not understand our Lord&rsquo;s heart, they could neither see nor
      read his face aright. But when we shall be fit to look that man in the
      face, God only knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you think, papa, that we, who have never seen him, could know him
      better than the disciples? I don&rsquo;t mean, of course, better than they knew
      him after he was taken away from them, but better than they knew him while
      he was still with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa! Is it possible? Why don&rsquo;t we all, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we won&rsquo;t take the trouble; that is the reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, what a grand thing to think! That would be worth living&mdash;worth
      being ill for. But how? how? Can&rsquo;t you help me? Mayn&rsquo;t one human being
      help another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the highest duty one human being owes to another. But whoever wants
      to learn must pray, and think, and, above all, obey&mdash;that is simply,
      do what Jesus says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a little silence, and I could hear my child sobbing. And
      the tears stood in; my wife&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;tears of gladness to hear her
      daughter&rsquo;s sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try, papa,&rdquo; Constance said at last. &ldquo;But you <i>will</i> help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I will, my love. I will help you in the best way I know; by trying
      to tell you what I have heard and learned about him&mdash;heard and
      learned of the Father, I hope and trust. It is coming near to the time
      when he was born;&mdash;but I have spoken quite as long as you are able to
      bear to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, papa. Do go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear; no more to-night. That would be to offend against the very
      truth I have been trying to set forth to you. But next Sunday&mdash;you
      have plenty to think about till then&mdash;I will talk to you about the
      baby Jesus; and perhaps I may find something more to help you by that
      time, besides what I have got to say now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think, Connie, this is too good to keep
      all to ourselves? Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to have Wynnie and Dora in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, mamma. Do let us have them in. And Harry and Charlie too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear they are rather young yet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Perhaps it might do them
      harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be all the better for us to have them anyhow,&rdquo; said Ethelwyn,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you will say things more simply if you have them by you. Besides,
      you always say such things to children as delight grown people, though
      they could never get them out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a wife&rsquo;s speech, reader. Forgive me for writing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind them coming in, but I don&rsquo;t promise to say
      anything directly to them. And you must let them go away the moment they
      wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered my wife; and so the matter was arranged.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. A SUNDAY EVENING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I went in to see Constance the next Sunday morning before going to
      church, I knew by her face that she was expecting the evening. I took care
      to get into no conversation with her during the day, that she might be
      quite fresh. In the evening, when I went into her room again with my Bible
      in my hand, I found all our little company assembled. There was a glorious
      fire, for it was very cold, and the little ones were seated on the rug
      before it, one on each side of their mother; Wynnie sat by the further
      side of the bed, for she always avoided any place or thing she thought
      another might like; and Dora sat by the further chimney-corner, leaving
      the space between the fire and my chair open that I might see and share
      the glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind is very high, papa,&rdquo; said Constance, as I seated myself beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear. It has been blowing all day, and since sundown it has blown
      harder. Do you like the wind, Connie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I do like it. When it roars like that in the chimneys, and
      shakes the windows with a great rush as if it <i>would</i> get into the
      house and tear us to pieces, and then goes moaning away into the woods and
      grumbles about in them till it grows savage again, and rushes up at us
      with fresh fury, I am afraid I delight in it. I feel so safe in the very
      jaws of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are quite poetic, Connie,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me, Wynnie. Mind I&rsquo;m an invalid, and I can&rsquo;t bear to be
      laughed at,&rdquo; returned Connie, half laughing herself, and a little more
      than a quarter crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie rose and kissed her, whispered something to her which made her
      laugh outright, and then sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, Connie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why you are <i>afraid</i> you enjoy
      hearing the wind about the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it must be so dreadful for those that are out in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not quite so bad as we think. You must not suppose that God has
      forgotten them, or cares less for them than for you because they are out
      in the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if we thought like that, papa,&rdquo; said Wynnie, &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t we come to
      feel that their sufferings were none of our business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If our benevolence rests on the belief that God is less loving than we,
      it will come to a bad end somehow before long, Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I could not think that,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your kindness would be such that you dared not, in God&rsquo;s name, think
      hopefully for those you could not help, lest you should, believing in his
      kindness, cease to help those whom you could help! Either God intended
      that there should be poverty and suffering, or he did not. If he did not
      intend it&mdash;for similar reasons to those for which he allows all sorts
      of evils&mdash;then there is nothing between but that we should sell
      everything that we have and give it away to the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said Wynnie, looking truth itself in my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that is not God&rsquo;s way, and we should do no end of harm by so
      doing. We should make so many more of those who will not help themselves
      who will not be set free from themselves by rising above themselves. We
      are not to gratify our own benevolence at the expense of its object&mdash;not
      to save our own souls as we fancy, by putting other souls into more danger
      than God meant for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds hard doctrine from your lips, papa,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many things will look hard in so many words, which yet will be found
      kindness itself when they are interpreted by a higher theory. If the one
      thing is to let people have everything they want, then of course everyone
      ought to be rich. I have no doubt such a man as we were reading of in the
      papers the other day, who saw his servant girl drown without making the
      least effort to save her, and then bemoaned the loss of her labour for the
      coming harvest, thinking himself ill-used in her death, would hug his own
      selfishness on hearing my words, and say, &lsquo;All right, parson! Every man
      for himself! I made my own money, and they may make theirs!&rsquo; <i>You</i>
      know that is not exactly the way I should think or act with regard to my
      neighbour. But if it were only that I have seen such noble characters cast
      in the mould of poverty, I should be compelled to regard poverty as one of
      God&rsquo;s powers in the world for raising the children of the kingdom, and to
      believe that it was not because it could not be helped that our Lord said,
      &lsquo;The poor ye have always with you.&rsquo; But what I wanted to say was, that
      there can be no reason why Connie should not enjoy what God has given her,
      although he has not thought fit to give as much to everybody; and above
      all, that we shall not help those right whom God gives us to help, if we
      do not believe that God is caring for every one of them as much as he is
      caring for every one of us. There was once a baby born in a stable,
      because his poor mother could get no room in a decent house. Where she lay
      I can hardly think. They must have made a bed of hay and straw for her in
      the stall, for we know the baby&rsquo;s cradle was the manger. Had God forsaken
      them? or would they not have been more <i>comfortable</i>, if that was the
      main thing, somewhere else? Ah! if the disciples, who were being born
      about the same time of fisher-fathers and cottage-mothers, to get ready
      for him to call and teach by the time he should be thirty years of age&mdash;if
      they had only been old enough, and had known that he was coming&mdash;would
      they not have got everything ready for him? They would have clubbed their
      little savings together, and worked day and night, and some rich women
      would have helped them, and they would have dressed the baby in fine
      linen, and got him the richest room their money would get, and they would
      have made the gold that the wise men brought into a crown for his little
      head, and would have burnt the frankincense before him. And so our little
      manger-baby would have been taken away from us. No more the stable-born
      Saviour&mdash;no more the poor Son of God born for us all, as strong, as
      noble, as loving, as worshipful, as beautiful as he was poor! And we
      should not have learned that God does not care for money; that if he does
      not give more of it it is not that it is scarce with him, or that he is
      unkind, but that he does not value it himself. And if he sent his own son
      to be not merely brought up in the house of the carpenter of a little
      village, but to be born in the stable of a village inn, we need not
      suppose because a man sleeps under a haystack and is put in prison for it
      next day, that God does not care for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did Jesus come so poor, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he might be just a human baby. That he might not be distinguished by
      this or by that accident of birth; that he might have nothing but a
      mother&rsquo;s love to welcome him, and so belong to everybody; that from the
      first he might show that the kingdom of God and the favour of God lie not
      in these external things at all&mdash;that the poorest little one, born in
      the meanest dwelling, or in none at all, is as much God&rsquo;s own and God&rsquo;s
      care as if he came in a royal chamber with colour and shine all about him.
      Had Jesus come amongst the rich, riches would have been more worshipped
      than ever. See how so many that count themselves good Christians honour
      possession and family and social rank, and I doubt hardly get rid of them
      when they are all swept away from them. The furthest most of such reach is
      to count Jesus an exception, and therefore not despise him. See how, even
      in the services of the church, as they call them, they will accumulate
      gorgeousness and cost. Had I my way, though I will never seek to rouse
      men&rsquo;s thoughts about such external things, I would never have any vessel
      used in the eucharist but wooden platters and wooden cups.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are we not to serve him with our best?&rdquo; said my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with our very hearts and souls, with our wills, with our absolute
      being. But all external things should be in harmony with the spirit of his
      revelation. And if God chose that his Son should visit the earth in homely
      fashion, in homely fashion likewise should be everything that enforces and
      commemorates that revelation. All church-forms should be on the other side
      from show and expense. Let the money go to build decent houses for God&rsquo;s
      poor, not to give them his holy bread and wine out of silver and gold and
      precious stones&mdash;stealing from the significance of the <i>content</i>
      by the meretricious grandeur of the <i>continent</i>. I would send all the
      church-plate to fight the devil with his own weapons in our overcrowded
      cities, and in our villages where the husbandmen are housed like swine, by
      giving them room to be clean and decent air from heaven to breathe. When
      the people find the clergy thus in earnest, they will follow them fast
      enough, and the money will come in like salt and oil upon the sacrifice. I
      would there were a few of our dignitaries that could think grandly about
      things, even as Jesus thought&mdash;even as God thought when he sent him.
      There are many of them willing to stand any amount of persecution about
      trifles: the same enthusiasm directed by high thoughts about the kingdom
      of heaven as within men and not around them, would redeem a vast region
      from that indifference which comes of judging the gospel of God by the
      church of Christ with its phylacteries and hems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing,&rdquo; said Wynnie, after a pause, &ldquo;that I have often
      thought about&mdash;why it was necessary for Jesus to come as a baby: he
      could not do anything for so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I would answer, Wynnie, that if you would tell me why it is
      necessary for all of us to come as babies, it would be less necessary for
      me to tell you why he came so: whatever was human must be his. But I would
      say next, Are you sure that he could not do anything for so long? Does a
      baby do nothing? Ask mamma there. Is it for nothing that the mother lifts
      up such heartfuls of thanks to God for the baby on her knee? Is it nothing
      that the baby opens such fountains of love in almost all the hearts
      around? Ah! you do not think how much every baby has to do with the saving
      of the world&mdash;the saving of it from selfishness, and folly, and
      greed. And for Jesus, was he not going to establish the reign of love in
      the earth? How could he do better than begin from babyhood? He had to lay
      hold of the heart of the world. How could he do better than begin with his
      mother&rsquo;s&mdash;the best one in it. Through his mother&rsquo;s love first, he
      grew into the world. It was first by the door of all the holy relations of
      the family that he entered the human world, laying hold of mother, father,
      brothers, sisters, all his friends; then by the door of labour, for he
      took his share of his father&rsquo;s work; then, when he was thirty years of
      age, by the door of teaching; by kind deeds, and sufferings, and through
      all by obedience unto the death. You must not think little of the grand
      thirty years wherein he got ready for the chief work to follow. You must
      not think that while he was thus preparing for his public ministrations,
      he was not all the time saving the world even by that which he was in the
      midst of it, ever laying hold of it more and more. These were things not
      so easy to tell. And you must remember that our records are very scanty.
      It is a small biography we have of a man who became&mdash;to say nothing
      more&mdash;the Man of the world&mdash;the Son of Man. No doubt it is
      enough, or God would have told us more; but surely we are not to suppose
      that there was nothing significant, nothing of saving power in that which
      we are not told.&mdash;Charlie, wouldn&rsquo;t you have liked to see the little
      baby Jesus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I would. I would have given him my white rabbit with the pink
      eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what the great painter Titian must have thought, Charlie; for he
      has painted him playing with a white rabbit,&mdash;not such a pretty one
      as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have carried him about all day,&rdquo; said Dora, &ldquo;as little Henny
      Parsons does her baby-brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he have any brother or sister to carry him about, papa?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my boy; for he was the eldest. But you may be pretty sure he carried
      about his brothers and sisters that came after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he take care of them, just!&rdquo; said Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had been one of them,&rdquo; said Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are one of them, my Connie. Now he is so great and so strong that he
      can carry father and mother and all of us in his bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we sung a child&rsquo;s hymn in praise of the God of little children, and
      the little ones went to bed. Constance was tired now, and we left her with
      Wynnie. We too went early to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight my wife and I awoke together&mdash;at least neither knew
      which waked the other. The wind was still raving about the house, with
      lulls between its charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a child crying!&rdquo; said my wife, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat up too, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some creature,&rdquo; I granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an infant,&rdquo; insisted my wife. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be either of the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was out of bed in a moment, and my wife the same instant. We hurried on
      some of our clothes, going to the windows and listening as we did so. We
      seemed to hear the wailing through the loudest of the wind, and in the
      lulls were sure of it. But it grew fainter as we listened. The night was
      pitch dark. I got a lantern, and hurried out. I went round the house till
      I came under our bed-room windows, and there listened. I heard it, but not
      so clearly as before. I set out as well as I could judge in the direction
      of the sound. I could find nothing. My lantern lighted only a few yards
      around me, and the wind was so strong that it blew through every chink,
      and threatened momently to blow it out. My wife was by my side before I
      knew she was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is not fit for you to be out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as fit for me as for a child, anyhow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly no time for expostulation. All the mother was awake in
      Ethelwyn&rsquo;s bosom. It would have been cruelty to make her go in, though she
      was indeed ill-fitted to encounter such a night-wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wail reached us. It seemed to come from a thicket at one corner of
      the lawn. We hurried thither. Again a cry, and we knew we were much nearer
      to it. Searching and searching we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; Ethelwyn almost screamed, as the feeble light of the
      lantern fell on a dark bundle of something under a bush. She caught at it.
      It gave another pitiful wail&mdash;the poor baby of some tramp, rolled up
      in a dirty, ragged shawl, and tied round with a bit of string, as if it
      had been a parcel of clouts. She set off running with it to the house, and
      I followed, much fearing she would miss her way in the dark, and fall. I
      could hardly get up with her, so eager was she to save the child. She
      darted up to her own room, where the fire was not yet out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run to the kitchen, Harry, and get some hot water. Take the two jugs
      there&mdash;you can empty them in the sink: you won&rsquo;t know where to find
      anything. There will be plenty in the boiler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time I returned with the hot water, she had taken off the child&rsquo;s
      covering, and was sitting with it, wrapped in a blanket, before the fire.
      The little thing was cold as a stone, and now silent and motionless. We
      had found it just in time. Ethelwyn ordered me about as if I had been a
      nursemaid. I poured the hot water into a footbath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some cold water, Harry. You would boil the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made me throw away the cold water,&rdquo; I said, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some in the bottles,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Make haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did try to make haste, but I could not be quick enough to satisfy
      Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child will be dead,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;before we get it in the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had its rags off in a moment&mdash;there was very little to remove
      after the shawl. How white the little thing was, though dreadfully
      neglected! It was a girl&mdash;not more than a few weeks old, we agreed.
      Her little heart was still beating feebly; and as she was a well-made,
      apparently healthy infant, we had every hope of recovering her. And we
      were not disappointed. She began to move her little legs and arms with
      short, convulsive motions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where the dairy is, Harry?&rdquo; asked my wife, with no great
      compliment to my bumps of locality, which I had always flattered myself
      were beyond the average in development.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you tell which was this night&rsquo;s milk, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be less cream on it,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring a little of that and some more hot water. I&rsquo;ve got some sugar here.
      I wish we had a bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I executed her commands faithfully. By the time I returned the child was
      lying on her lap clean and dry&mdash;a fine baby I thought. Ethelwyn went
      on talking to her, and praising her as if she had not only been the finest
      specimen of mortality in the world, but her own child to boot. She got her
      to take a few spoonfuls of milk and water, and then the little thing fell
      fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethelwyn&rsquo;s nursing days were not so far gone by that she did not know
      where her baby&rsquo;s clothes were. She gave me the child, and going to a
      wardrobe in the room brought out some night-things, and put them on. I
      could not understand in the least why the sleeping darling must be indued
      with little chemise, and flannel, and nightgown, and I do not know what
      all, requiring a world of nice care, and a hundred turnings to and fro,
      now on its little stomach, now on its back, now sitting up, now lying
      down, when it would have slept just as well, and I venture to think much
      more comfortably, if laid in blankets and well covered over. But I had
      never ventured to interfere with any of my own children, devoutly
      believing up to this moment, though in a dim unquestioning way, that there
      must be some hidden feminine wisdom in the whole process; and now that I
      had begun to question it, I found that my opportunity had long gone by, if
      I had ever had one. And after all there may be some reason for it, though
      I confess I do strongly suspect that all these matters are so wonderfully
      complicated in order that the girl left in the woman may have her heart&rsquo;s
      content of playing with her doll; just as the woman hid in the girl
      expends no end of lovely affection upon the dull stupidity of wooden
      cheeks and a body of sawdust. But it was a delight to my heart to see how
      Ethelwyn could not be satisfied without treating the foundling in
      precisely the same fashion as one of her own. And if this was a necessary
      preparation for what, should follow, I would be the very last to complain
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to bed again, and the forsaken child of some half-animal mother,
      now perhaps asleep in some filthy lodging for tramps, lay in my Ethelwyn&rsquo;s
      bosom. I loved her the more for it; though, I confess, it would have been
      very painful to me had she shown it possible for her to treat the baby
      otherwise, especially after what we had been talking about that same
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we had another child in the house, and nobody knew anything about it
      but ourselves two. The household had never been disturbed by all the going
      and coming. After everything had been done for her, we had a good laugh
      over the whole matter, and then Ethelwyn fell a-crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray for the poor thing, Harry,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;before you come to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knelt down, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord our Father, this is as much thy child and as certainly sent to us
      as if she had been born of us. Help us to keep the child for thee. Take
      thou care of thy own, and teach us what to do with her, and how to order
      our ways towards her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I said to Ethelwyn,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will not say one word more about it tonight. You must try to go to
      sleep. I daresay the little thing will sleep till the morning, and I am
      sure I shall if she does. Good-night, my love. You are a true mother. Mind
      you go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am half asleep already, Harry. Good-night,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know nothing more about anything till I in the morning, except that I
      had a dream, which I have not made up my mind yet whether I shall tell or
      not. We slept soundly&mdash;God&rsquo;s baby and all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. MY DREAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think I will tell the dream I had. I cannot well account for the
      beginning of it: the end will appear sufficiently explicable to those who
      are quite satisfied that they get rid of the mystery of a thing when they
      can associate it with something else with which they are familiar. Such do
      not care to see that the thing with which they associate it may be as
      mysterious as the other. For although use too often destroys marvel, it
      cannot destroy the marvellous. The origin of our thoughts is just as
      wonderful as the origin of our dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my dream I found myself in a pleasant field full of daisies and white
      clover. The sun was setting. The wind was going one way, and the shadows
      another. I felt rather tired, I neither knew nor thought why. With an old
      man&rsquo;s prudence, I would not sit down upon the grass, but looked about for
      a more suitable seat. Then I saw, for often in our dreams there is an
      immediate response to our wishes, a long, rather narrow stone lying a few
      yards from me. I wondered how it could have come there, for there were no
      mountains or rocks near: the field was part of a level country.
      Carelessly, I sat down upon it astride, and watched the setting of the
      sun. Somehow I fancied that his light was more sorrowful than the light of
      the setting sun should be, and I began to feel very heavy at the heart. No
      sooner had the last brilliant spark of his light vanished, than I felt the
      stone under me begin to move. With the inactivity of a dreamer, however, I
      did not care to rise, but wondered only what would come next. My seat,
      after several strange tumbling motions, seemed to rise into the air a
      little way, and then I found that I was astride of a gaunt, bony horse&mdash;a
      skeleton horse almost, only he had a gray skin on him. He began,
      apparently with pain, as if his joints were all but too stiff to move, to
      go forward in the direction in which he found himself. I kept my seat.
      Indeed, I never thought of dismounting. I was going on to meet what might
      come. Slowly, feebly, trembling at every step, the strange steed went, and
      as he went his joints seemed to become less stiff, and he went a little
      faster. All at once I found that the pleasant field had vanished, and that
      we were on the borders of a moor. Straight forward the horse carried me,
      and the moor grew very rough, and he went stumbling dreadfully, but always
      recovering himself. Every moment it seemed as if he would fall to rise no
      more, but as often he found fresh footing. At length the surface became a
      little smoother, and he began a horrible canter which lasted till he
      reached a low, broken wall, over which he half walked, half fell into what
      was plainly an ancient neglected churchyard. The mounds were low and
      covered with rank grass. In some parts, hollows had taken the place of
      mounds. Gravestones lay in every position except the level or the upright,
      and broken masses of monuments were scattered about. My horse bore me into
      the midst of it, and there, slow and stiff as he had risen, he lay down
      again. Once more I was astride of a long narrow stone. And now I found
      that it was an ancient gravestone which I knew well in a certain Sussex
      churchyard, the top of it carved into the rough resemblance of a human
      skeleton&mdash;that of a man, tradition said, who had been killed by a
      serpent that came out of a bottomless pool in the next field. How long I
      sat there I do not know; but at last I saw the faint gray light of morning
      begin to appear in front of me. The horse of death had carried me
      eastward. The dawn grew over the top of a hill that here rose against the
      horizon. But it was a wild dreary dawn&mdash;a blot of gray first, which
      then stretched into long lines of dreary yellow and gray, looking more
      like a blasted and withered sunset than a fresh sunrise. And well it
      suited that waste, wide, deserted churchyard, if churchyard I ought to
      call it where no church was to be seen&mdash;only a vast hideous square of
      graves. Before me I noticed especially one old grave, the flat stone of
      which had broken in two and sunk in the middle. While I sat with my eyes
      fixed on this stone, it began to move; the crack in the middle closed,
      then widened again as the two halves of the stone were lifted up, and
      flung outward, like the two halves of a folding door. From the grave rose
      a little child, smiling such perfect contentment as if he had just come
      from kissing his mother. His little arms had flung the stones apart, and
      as he stood on the edge of the grave next to me, they remained outspread
      from the action for a moment, as if blessing the sleeping people. Then he
      came towards me with the same smile, and took my hand. I rose, and he led
      me away over another broken wall towards the hill that lay before us. And
      as we went the sun came nearer, the pale yellow bars flushed into orange
      and rosy red, till at length the edges of the clouds were swept with an
      agony of golden light, which even my dreamy eyes could not endure, and I
      awoke weeping for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This waking woke my wife, who said in some alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I told her my dream, and how in my sleep my gladness had overcome me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was this little darling that set you dreaming so,&rdquo; she said, and
      turning, put the baby in my arms.

      CHAPTER VI. THE NEW BABY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will not attempt to describe the astonishment of the members of our
      household, each in succession, as the news of the child spread. Charlie
      was heard shouting across the stable-yard to his brother:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, Harry! Mamma has got a new baby. Isn&rsquo;t it jolly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did she get it?&rdquo; cried Harry in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the parsley-bed, I suppose,&rdquo; answered Charlie, and was nearer right
      than usual, for the information on which his conclusion was founded had no
      doubt been imparted as belonging to the history of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my reader can easily imagine the utter bewilderment of those of the
      family whose knowledge of human affairs would not allow of their curiosity
      being so easily satisfied as that of the boys. In them was exemplified
      that confusion of the intellectual being which is produced by the witness
      of incontestable truth to a thing incredible&mdash;in which case the
      probability always is, that the incredibility results from something in
      the mind of the hearer falsely associated with and disturbing the true
      perception of the thing to which witness is borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the astonishment confined to the family, for it spread over the
      parish that Mrs. Walton had got another baby. And so, indeed, she had. And
      seldom has baby met with a more hearty welcome than this baby met with
      from everyone of our family. They hugged it first, and then asked
      questions. And that, I say, is the right way of receiving every good gift
      of God. Ask what questions you will, but when you see that the gift is a
      good one, make sure that you take it. There is plenty of time for you to
      ask questions afterwards. Then the better you love the gift, the more
      ready you will be to ask, and the more fearless in asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth, however, soon became known. And then, strange to relate, we
      began to receive visits of condolence. O, that poor baby! how it was
      frowned upon, and how it had heads shaken over it, just because it was not
      Ethelwyn&rsquo;s baby! It could not help that, poor darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ll give information to the police,&rdquo; said, I am sorry to
      say, one of my brethren in the neighbourhood, who had the misfortune to be
      a magistrate as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! That they may discover the parents, to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be as hard a matter to prove the parentage, as it would be
      easy to suspect it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;And just think what it would be to give the
      baby to a woman who not only did not want her, but who was not her mother.
      But if her own mother came to claim her now, I don&rsquo;t say I would refuse
      her, but I should think twice about giving her up after she had once
      abandoned her for a whole night in the open air. In fact I don&rsquo;t want the
      parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want the child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; I returned&mdash;rather rudely, I am afraid, for I
      am easily annoyed at anything that seems to me heartless&mdash;about
      children especially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! of course, if you want to have an orphan asylum of your own, no one
      has a right to interfere. But you ought to consider other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I thought I was doing,&rdquo; I answered; but he went on
      without heeding my reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all be having babies left at our doors, and some of us are not
      so fond of them as you are. Remember, you are your brother&rsquo;s keeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my sister&rsquo;s too,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And if the question lies between
      keeping a big, burly brother like you, and a tiny, wee sister like that, I
      venture to choose for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to go to the workhouse,&rdquo; said the magistrate&mdash;a friendly,
      good-natured man enough in ordinary&mdash;and rising, he took his hat and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man had no children. So he was&mdash;or was not, so much to blame.
      Which? <i>I</i> say the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Ethelwyn&rsquo;s friends were no less positive about her duty in the
      affair. I happened to go into the drawing-room during the visit of one of
      them&mdash;Miss Bowdler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Mrs. Walton,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be having all the
      tramps in England leaving their babies at your door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better for the babies,&rdquo; interposed I, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t think of your wife, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? I thought I did,&rdquo; I returned dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend upon it, you&rsquo;ll repent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall never repent of anything but what is bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but, really! it&rsquo;s not a thing to be made game of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. The baby shall be treated with all due respect in this
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a provoking man you are! You know what I mean well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as I choose to know&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady was one of my oldest parishioners, and took liberties for which
      she had no other justification, except indeed an unhesitating belief in
      the superior rectitude of whatever came into her own head can be counted
      as one. When she was gone, my wife turned to me with a half-comic,
      half-anxious look, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be rather alarming, Harry, if this were to get abroad, and
      we couldn&rsquo;t go out at the door in the morning without being in danger of
      stepping on a baby on the door-step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well have said, when you were going to be married, &lsquo;If God
      should send me twenty children, whatever should I do?&rsquo; He who sent us this
      one can surely prevent any more from coming than he wants to come. All
      that we have to think of is to do right&mdash;not the consequences of
      doing right. But leaving all that aside, you must not suppose that
      wandering mothers have not even the attachment of animals to their
      offspring. There are not so many that are willing to part with babies as
      all that would come to. If you believe that God sent this one, that is
      enough for the present. If he should send another, we should know by that
      that we had to take it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife said the baby was a beauty. I could see that she was a plump,
      well-to-do baby; and being by nature no particular lover of babies as
      babies&mdash;that is, feeling none of the inclination of mothers and
      nurses and elder sisters to eat them, or rather, perhaps, loving more for
      what I believed than what I saw&mdash;that was all I could pretend to
      discover. But even the aforementioned elderly parishioner was compelled to
      allow before three months were over that little Theodora&mdash;for we
      turned the name of my youngest daughter upside down for her&mdash;&ldquo;was a
      proper child.&rdquo; To none, however, did she seem to bring so much delight as
      to our dear Constance. Oftener than not, when I went into her room, I
      found the sleepy, useless little thing lying beside her on the bed, and
      her staring at it with such loving eyes! How it began, I do not know, but
      it came at last to be called Connie&rsquo;s Dora, or Miss Connie&rsquo;s baby, all
      over the house, and nothing pleased Connie better. Not till she saw this
      did her old nurse take quite kindly to the infant; for she regarded her as
      an interloper, who had no right to the tenderness which was lavished upon
      her. But she had no sooner given in than the baby began to grow dear to
      her as well as to the rest. In fact, the house was ere long full of
      nurses. The staff included everyone but myself, who only occasionally, at
      the entreaty of some one or other of the younger ones, took her in my
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before she was three months old, anxious thoughts began to intrude,
      all centering round the question in what manner the child was to be
      brought up. Certainly there was time enough to think of this, as Ethelwyn
      constantly reminded me; but what made me anxious was that I could not
      discover the principle that ought to guide me. Now no one can tell how
      soon a principle in such a case will begin, even unconsciously, to
      operate; and the danger was that the moment when it ought to begin to
      operate would be long past before the principle was discovered, except I
      did what I could now to find it out. I had again and again to remind
      myself that there was no cause for anxiety; for that I might certainly
      claim the enlightenment which all who want to do right are sure to
      receive; but still I continued uneasy just from feeling a vacancy where a
      principle ought to have been.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. ANOTHER SUNDAY EVENING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During all this time Connie made no very perceptible progress&mdash;in the
      recovery of her bodily powers, I mean, for her heart and mind advanced
      remarkably. We held our Sunday-evening assemblies in her room pretty
      regularly, my occasional absence in the exercise of my duties alone
      interfering with them. In connection with one of these, I will show how I
      came at length to make up my mind as to what I would endeavour to keep
      before me as my object in the training of little Theodora, always
      remembering that my preparation might be used for a very different end
      from what I purposed. If my intention was right, the fact that it might be
      turned aside would not trouble me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had spoken a good deal together about the infancy and childhood of
      Jesus, about the shepherds, and the wise men, and the star in the east,
      and the children of Bethlehem. I encouraged the thoughts of all the
      children to rest and brood upon the fragments that are given us, and,
      believing that the imagination is one of the most powerful of all the
      faculties for aiding the growth of truth in the mind, I would ask them
      questions as to what they thought he might have said or done in ordinary
      family occurrences, thus giving a reality in their minds to this part of
      his history, and trying to rouse in them a habit of referring their
      conduct to the standard of his. If we do not thus employ our imagination
      on sacred things, his example can be of no use to us except in exactly
      corresponding circumstances&mdash;and when can such occur from one end to
      another of our lives? The very effort to think how he would have done, is
      a wonderful purifier of the conscience, and, even if the conclusion
      arrived at should not be correct from lack of sufficient knowledge of his
      character and principles, it will be better than any that can be arrived
      at without this inquiry. Besides, the asking of such questions gave me
      good opportunity, through the answers they returned, of seeing what their
      notions of Jesus and of duty were, and thus of discovering how to help the
      dawn of the light in their growing minds. Nor let anyone fear that such
      employment of the divine gift of imagination will lead to foolish vagaries
      and useless inventions; while the object is to discover the right way&mdash;the
      truth&mdash;there is little danger of that. Besides, there I was to help
      hereby in the actual training of their imaginations to truth and wisdom.
      To aid in this, I told them some of the stories that were circulated about
      him in the early centuries of the church, but which the church has
      rejected as of no authority; and I showed them how some of them could not
      be true, because they were so unlike those words and actions which we had
      the best of reasons for receiving as true; and how one or two of them
      might be true&mdash;though, considering the company in which we found
      them, we could say nothing for certain concerning them. And such wise
      things as those children said sometimes! It is marvellous how children can
      reach the heart of the truth at once. Their utterances are sometimes
      entirely concordant with the results arrived at through years of thought
      by the earnest mind&mdash;results which no mind would ever arrive at save
      by virtue of the child-like in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, upon this evening I read to them the story of the boy Jesus in
      the temple. Then I sought to make the story more real to them by dwelling
      a little on the growing fears of his parents as they went from group to
      group of their friends, tracing back the road towards Jerusalem and asking
      every fresh company they knew if they had seen their boy, till at length
      they were in great trouble when they could not find him even in Jerusalem.
      Then came the delight of his mother when she did find him at last, and his
      answer to what she said. Now, while I thus lingered over the simple story,
      my children had put many questions to me about Jesus being a boy, and not
      seeming to know things which, if he was God, he must have known, they
      thought. To some of these I had just to reply that I did not understand
      myself, and therefore could not teach them; to others, that I could
      explain them, but that they were not yet, some of them, old enough to
      receive and understand my explanation; while others I did my best to
      answer as simply as I could. But at this point we arrived at a question
      put by Wynnie, to answer which aright I considered of the greatest
      importance. Wynnie said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just one of the things about Jesus that have always troubled me,
      papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is, my dear?&rdquo; I said; for although I thought I knew well enough what
      she meant, I wished her to set it forth in her own words, both for her own
      sake, and the sake of the others, who would probably understand the
      difficulty much better if she presented it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that he spoke to his mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say <i>mamma</i>, Wynnie?&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;She was his own
      mamma, wasn&rsquo;t she, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear; but don&rsquo;t you know that the shoemaker&rsquo;s children down in
      the village always call their mamma <i>mother</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but they are shoemaker&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jesus was one of that class of people. He was the son of a
      carpenter. He called his mamma, <i>mother</i>. But, Charlie, <i>mother</i>
      is the more beautiful word of the two, by a great deal, I think. <i>Lady</i>
      is a very pretty word; but <i>woman</i> is a very beautiful word. Just so
      with <i>mamma</i> and <i>mother</i>. <i>Mamma</i> is pretty, but <i>mother</i>
      is beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we always say <i>mother</i> then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because it is the most beautiful, and so we keep it for Sundays&mdash;that
      is, for the more solemn times of life. We don&rsquo;t want it to get common to
      us with too much use. We may think it as much as we like; thinking does
      not spoil it; but saying spoils many things, and especially beautiful
      words. Now we must let Wynnie finish what she was saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying, papa, that I can&rsquo;t help feeling as if&mdash;I know it can&rsquo;t
      be true&mdash;but I feel as if Jesus spoke unkindly to his mother when he
      said that to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the page and read the words, &ldquo;How is it that ye sought me?
      wist ye not that I must be about my Father&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; And I sat silent
      for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak, papa?&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sitting wondering at myself, Harry,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Long after I was your
      age, Wynnie, I remember quite well that those words troubled me as they
      now trouble you. But when I read them over now, they seemed to me so
      lovely that I could hardly read them aloud. I can recall the fact that
      they troubled me, but the mode of the fact I scarcely can recall. I can
      hardly see now wherein lay the hurt or offence the words gave me. And why
      is that? Simply because I understand them now, and I did not understand
      them then. I took them as uttered with a tone of reproof; now I hear them
      as uttered with a tone of loving surprise. But really I cannot feel sure
      what it was that I did not like. And I am confident it is so with a great
      many things that we reject. We reject them simply because we do not
      understand them. Therefore, indeed, we cannot with truth be said to reject
      them at all. It is some false appearance that we reject. Some of the
      grandest things in the whole realm of truth look repellent to us, and we
      turn away from them, simply because we are not&mdash;to use a familiar
      phrase&mdash;we are not up to them. They appear to us, therefore, to be
      what they are not. Instruction sounds to the proud man like reproof;
      illumination comes on the vain man like scorn; the manifestation of a
      higher condition of motive and action than his own, falls on the
      self-esteeming like condemnation; but it is consciousness and conscience
      working together that produce this impression; the result is from the man
      himself, not from the higher source. From the truth comes the power, but
      the shape it assumes to the man is from the man himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite beyond me now, papa,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I will return to the words of the boy Jesus,
      instead of talking more about them; and when I have shown you what they
      mean, I think you will allow that that feeling you have about them is all
      and altogether an illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing first,&rdquo; said Connie, &ldquo;that I want to understand. You
      said the words of Jesus rather indicated surprise. But how could he be
      surprised at anything? If he was God, he must have known everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tells us himself that he did not know everything. He says once that
      even <i>he</i> did not know one thing&mdash;only the Father knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could that be if he was God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, that is one of the things that it seems to me impossible I
      should understand. Certainly I think his trial as a man would not have
      been perfect had he known everything. He too had to live by faith in the
      Father. And remember that for the Divine Sonship on earth perfect
      knowledge was not necessary, only perfect confidence, absolute obedience,
      utter holiness. There is a great tendency in our sinful natures to put
      knowledge and power on a level with goodness. It was one of the lessons of
      our Lord&rsquo;s life that they are not so; that the one grand thing in humanity
      is faith in God; that the highest in God is his truth, his goodness, his
      rightness. But if Jesus was a real man, and no mere appearance of a man,
      is it any wonder that, with a heart full to the brim of the love of God,
      he should be for a moment surprised that his mother, whom he loved so
      dearly, the best human being he knew, should not have taken it as a matter
      of course that if he was not with her, he must be doing something his
      Father wanted him to do? For this is just what his answer means. To turn
      it into the ordinary speech of our day, it is just this: &lsquo;Why did you look
      for me? Didn&rsquo;t you know that I must of course be doing something my Father
      had given me to do?&rsquo; Just think of the quiet sweetness of confidence in
      this. And think what a life his must have been up to that twelfth year of
      his, that such an expostulation with his mother was justified. It must
      have had reference to a good many things that had passed before then,
      which ought to have been sufficient to make Mary conclude that her missing
      boy must be about God&rsquo;s business somewhere. If her heart had been as full
      of God and God&rsquo;s business as his, she would not have been in the least
      uneasy about him. And here is the lesson of his whole life: it was all his
      Father&rsquo;s business. The boy&rsquo;s mind and hands were full of it. The man&rsquo;s
      mind and hands were full of it. And the risen conqueror was full of it
      still. For the Father&rsquo;s business is everything, and includes all work that
      is worth doing. We may say in a full grand sense, that there is nothing
      but the Father and his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have so many things to do that are not his business,&rdquo; said Wynnie,
      with a sigh of oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one, my darling. If anything is not his business, you not only have
      not to do it, but you ought not to do it. Your words come from the want of
      spiritual sight. We cannot see the truth in common things&mdash;the will
      of God in little everyday affairs, and that is how they become so irksome
      to us. Show a beautiful picture, one full of quiet imagination and deep
      thought, to a common-minded man; he will pass it by with some slight
      remark, thinking it very ordinary and commonplace. That is because he is
      commonplace. Because our minds are so commonplace, have so little of the
      divine imagination in them, therefore we do not recognise the spiritual
      meaning and worth, we do not perceive the beautiful will of God, in the
      things required of us, though they are full of it. But if we do them we
      shall thus make acquaintance with them, and come to see what is in them.
      The roughest kernel amongst them has a tree of life in its heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he would tell me something to do,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I do
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no reply, but waited for an opportunity which I was pretty sure was
      at hand, while I carried the matter a little further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look here, Wynnie; listen to this,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;&lsquo;And he went down with
      them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.&rsquo; Was that not doing
      his Father&rsquo;s business too? Was it not doing the business of his Father in
      heaven to honour his father and his mother, though he knew that his days
      would not be long in that land? Did not his whole teaching, his whole
      doing, rest on the relation of the Son to the Father and surely it was
      doing his Father&rsquo;s business then to obey his parents&mdash;to serve them,
      to be subject to them. It is true that the business God gives a man to do
      may be said to be the peculiar walk in life into which he is led, but that
      is only as distinguishing it from another man&rsquo;s peculiar business. God
      gives us all our business, and the business which is common to humanity is
      more peculiarly God&rsquo;s business than that which is one man&rsquo;s and not
      another&rsquo;s&mdash;because it lies nearer the root, and is essential. It does
      not matter whether a man is a farmer or a physician, but it greatly
      matters whether he is a good son, a good husband, and so on. O my
      children!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if the world could but be brought to believe&mdash;the
      world did I say?&mdash;if the best men in the world could only see, as God
      sees it, that service is in itself the noblest exercise of human powers,
      if they could see that God is the hardest worker of all, and that his
      nobility are those who do the most service, surely it would alter the
      whole aspect of the church. Menial offices, for instance, would soon cease
      to be talked of with that contempt which shows that there is no true
      recognition of the fact that the same principle runs through the highest
      duty and the lowest&mdash;that the lowest work which God gives a man to do
      must be in its nature noble, as certainly noble as the highest. This would
      destroy condescension, which is the rudeness, yes, impertinence, of the
      higher, as it would destroy insolence, which is the rudeness of the lower.
      He who recognised the dignity of his own lower office, would thereby
      recognise the superiority of the higher office, and would be the last
      either to envy or degrade it. He would see in it his own&mdash;only
      higher, only better, and revere it. But I am afraid I have wearied you, my
      children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no, papa!&rdquo; said the elder ones, while the little ones gaped and said
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am in danger of doing so when I come to speak upon this subject:
      it has such a hold of my heart and mind!&mdash;Now, Charlie, my boy, go to
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Charlie was very comfortable before the fire, on the rug, and did not
      want to go. First one shoulder went up, and then the other, and the
      corners of his mouth went down, as if to keep the balance true. He did not
      move to go. I gave him a few moments to recover himself, but as the black
      frost still endured, I thought it was time to hold up a mirror to him.
      When he was a very little boy, he was much in the habit of getting out of
      temper, and then as now, he made a face that was hideous to behold; and to
      cure him of this, I used to make him carry a little mirror about his neck,
      that the means might be always at hand of showing himself to him: it was a
      sort of artificial conscience which, by enabling him to see the picture of
      his own condition, which the face always is, was not unfrequently
      operative in rousing his real conscience, and making him ashamed of
      himself. But now the mirror I wanted to hold up to him was a past mood, in
      the light of which the present would show what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a little while ago you were wishing that God would
      give you something to do. And now when he does, you refuse at once,
      without even thinking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that God wants me to go to bed?&rdquo; said Charlie, with
      something of surly impertinence, which I did not meet with reproof at once
      because there was some sense along with the impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that God wants you to do what I tell you, and to do it pleasantly.
      Do you think the boy Jesus would have put on such a face as that&mdash;I
      wish I had the little mirror to show it to you&mdash;when his mother told
      him it was time to go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now Charlie began to look ashamed. I left the truth to work in him,
      because I saw it was working. Had I not seen that, I should have compelled
      him to go at once, that he might learn the majesty of law. But now that
      his own better self, the self enlightened of the light that lighteneth
      every man that cometh into the world, was working, time might well be
      afforded it to work its perfect work. I went on talking to the others. In
      the space of not more than one minute, he rose and came to me, looking
      both good and ashamed, and held up his face to kiss me, saying,
      &ldquo;Goodnight, papa.&rdquo; I bade him good-night, and kissed him more tenderly
      than usual, that he might know that it was all right between us. I
      required no formal apology, no begging of my pardon, as some parents think
      right. It seemed enough to me that his heart was turned. It is a terrible
      thing to run the risk of changing humility into humiliation. Humiliation
      is one of the proudest conditions in the human world. When he felt that it
      would be a relief to say more explicitly, &ldquo;Father, I have sinned,&rdquo; then
      let him say it; but not till then. To compel manifestation is one surest
      way to check feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      My readers must not judge it silly to record a boy&rsquo;s unwillingness to go
      to bed. It is precisely the same kind of disobedience that some of them
      are guilty of themselves, and that in things not one whit more important
      than this, only those things happen to be <i>their</i> wish at the moment,
      and not Charlie&rsquo;s, and so gain their superiority.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THEODORA&rsquo;S DOOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Try not to get weary, respected reader, of so much of what I am afraid
      most people will call tiresome preaching. But I know if you get anything
      practicable out of it, you will not be so soon tired of it. I promise you
      more story by and by. Only an old man, like an old horse, must be allowed
      to take very much his own way&mdash;go his own pace, I should have said. I
      am afraid there must be a little more of a similar sort in this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday morning I set out to visit one or two people whom the
      severity of the weather had kept from church on the Sunday. The last
      severe frost, as it turned out, of the season, was possessing the earth.
      The sun was low in the wintry sky, and what seemed a very cold mist up in
      the air hid him from the earth. I was walking along a path in a field
      close by a hedge. A tree had been cut down, and lay upon the grass. A
      short distance from it lay its own figure marked out in hoar-frost. There
      alone was there any hoar-frost on the field; the rest was all of the
      loveliest tenderest green. I will not say the figure was such an exact
      resemblance as a photograph would have been; still it was an indubitable
      likeness. It appeared to the hasty glance that not a branch not a knot of
      the upper side of the tree at least was left unrepresented in shining and
      glittering whiteness upon the green grass. It was very pretty, and, I
      confess, at first, very puzzling. I walked on, meditating on the
      phenomenon, till at length I found out its cause. The hoar-frost had been
      all over the field in the morning. The sun had been shining for a time,
      and had melted the frost away, except where he could only cast a shadow.
      As he rose and rose, the shadow of the tree had shortened and come nearer
      and nearer to its original, growing more and more like as it came nearer,
      while the frost kept disappearing as the shadow withdrew its protection.
      When the shadow extended only to a little way from the tree, the clouds
      came and covered the sun, and there were no more shadows, only one great
      one of the clouds. Then the frost shone out in the shape of the vanished
      shadow. It lay at a little distance from the tree, because the tree having
      been only partially lopped, some great stumps of boughs held it up from
      the ground, and thus, when the sun was low, his light had shone a little
      way through beneath, as well as over the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reader needs not be afraid; I am not going to &ldquo;moralise this spectacle
      with a thousand similes.&rdquo; I only tell it him as a very pretty phenomenon.
      But I confess I walked on moralising it. Any new thing in nature&mdash;I
      mean new in regard to my knowledge, of course&mdash;always made me happy;
      and I was full of the quiet pleasure it had given me and of the thoughts
      it had brought me, when, as I was getting over a stile, whom should I see
      in the next field, coming along the footpath, but the lady who had made
      herself so disagreeable about Theodora. The sight was rather a discord in
      my feeling at that moment; perhaps it would have been so at any moment.
      But I prepared myself to meet her in the strength of the good humour which
      nature had just bestowed upon me. For I fear the failing will go with me
      to the grave that I am very ready to be annoyed, even to the loss of my
      temper, at the urgings of ignoble prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Bowdler,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; she returned &ldquo;I am afraid you thought me
      impertinent the other week; but you know by this time it is only my way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As such I take it,&rdquo; I answered with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not seem quite satisfied that I did not defend her from her own
      accusation; but as it was a just one, I could not do so. Therefore she
      went on to repeat the offence by way of justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all for Mrs. Walton&rsquo;s sake. You ought to consider her, Mr. Walton.
      She has quite enough to do with that dear Connie, who is likely to be an
      invalid all her days&mdash;too much to take the trouble of a beggar&rsquo;s brat
      as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mrs. Walton been complaining to you about it, Miss Bowdler?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear, no!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;She is far too good to complain of anything.
      That&rsquo;s just why her friends must look after her a bit, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I beg you won&rsquo;t speak disrespectfully of my little Theodora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear me! no. Not at all. I don&rsquo;t speak disrespectfully of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even amongst the class of which she comes, &lsquo;a beggar&rsquo;s brat&rsquo; would be
      regarded as bad language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, I&rsquo;m sure, Mr. Walton! If you <i>will</i> take offence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do take offence. And you know there is One who has given especial
      warning against offending the little ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bowdler walked away in high displeasure&mdash;let me hope in
      conviction of sin as well. She did not appear in church for the next two
      Sundays. Then she came again. But she called very seldom at the Hall after
      this, and I believe my wife was not sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now whether it came in any way from what that lady had said as to my
      wife&rsquo;s trouble with Constance and Theodora together, I can hardly tell;
      but, before I had reached home, I had at last got a glimpse of something
      like the right way, as it appeared to me, of bringing up Theodora. When I
      went into the house, I looked for my wife to have a talk with her about
      it; but, indeed, it always necessary to find her every time I got home. I
      found her in Connie&rsquo;s room as I had expected. Now although we were never
      in the habit of making mysteries of things in which there was no mystery,
      and talked openly before our children, and the more openly the older they
      grew, yet there were times when we wanted to have our talks quite alone,
      especially when we had not made up our minds about something. So I asked
      Ethelwyn to walk out with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t just this moment, husband,&rdquo; she answered. She was in
      the way of using that form of address, for she said it meant everything
      without saying it aloud. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just this moment, for there is no one at
      liberty to stay with Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, never mind me, mamma,&rdquo; said Connie cheerfully. &ldquo;Theodora will take
      care of me,&rdquo; and she looked fondly at the child, who was lying by her side
      fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; I said. And both, looked up surprised, for neither knew what I
      meant. &ldquo;I will tell you afterwards,&rdquo; I said, laughing. &ldquo;Come along,
      Ethel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can ring the bell, you know, Connie, if you should want anything, or
      your baby should wake up and be troublesome. You won&rsquo;t want me long, will
      you, husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure about that. You must tell Susan to watch for the bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan was the old nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethel put on her hooded cloak, and we went out together. I took her across
      to the field where I had seen the hoary shadow. The sun had not shone out,
      and I hoped it would be there to gladden her dear eyes as it had gladdened
      mine; but it was gone. The warmth of the sun, without his direct rays, had
      melted it away, as sacred influences will sometimes do with other shadows,
      without the mind knowing any more than the grass how the shadow departed.
      There, reader! I have got a bit of a moral in about it before you knew
      what I was doing. But I was sorry my wife could see it only through my
      eyes and words. Then I told her about Miss Bowdler, and what she had said.
      Ethel was very angry at her impertinence in speaking so to me. That was a
      wife&rsquo;s feeling, you know, and perhaps excusable in the first impression of
      the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that she was sent into the world to keep
      other people right instead of herself. I am very glad you set her down, as
      the maids say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much harm in her,&rdquo; I returned, which was easy
      generosity, seeing my wife was taking my part. &ldquo;Indeed, I am not sure that
      we are not both considerably indebted to her; for it was after I met her
      that a thought came into my head as to how we ought to do with Theodora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still troubling yourself about that, husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The longer the difficulty lasts, the more necessary is it that it should
      be met,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Our measures must begin sometime, and when, who can
      tell? We ought to have them in our heads, or they will never begin at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I confess they are rather of a general nature at present&mdash;belonging
      to humanity rather than the individual, as you would say&mdash;consisting
      chiefly in washing, dressing, feeding, and apostrophe, varied with
      lullabying. But our hearts are a better place for our measures than our
      heads, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; I walk corrected. Only there&rsquo;s no fear about your heart. I&rsquo;m
      not quite so sure about your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, husband. But with you for a head it doesn&rsquo;t matter, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. People should always strengthen the weaker part, for
      no chain is stronger than its weakest link; no fortification stronger than
      its most assailable point. But, seriously, wife, I trust your head nearly,
      though not quite, as much as your heart. Now to go to business. There&rsquo;s
      one thing we have both made up our minds about&mdash;that there is to be
      no concealment with the child. God&rsquo;s fact must be known by her. It would
      be cruel to keep the truth from her, even if it were not sure to come upon
      her with a terrible shock some day. She must know from the first, by
      hearing it talked of&mdash;not by solemn and private communication&mdash;that
      she came out of the shrubbery. That&rsquo;s settled, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I see that to be the right way,&rdquo; responded Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, are we bound to bring her up exactly as our own, or are we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are bound to do as well for her as for our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly. But if we brought her up just as our own, would that, the
      facts being as they are, be to do as well for her as for our own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it; for other people would not choose to receive her as we have
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. She would be continually reminded of her origin. Not that
      that in itself would be any evil; but as they would do it by excluding or
      neglecting her, or, still worse, by taking liberties with her, it would be
      a great pain. But keeping that out of view, would it be good for herself,
      knowing what she will know, to be thus brought up? Would it not be kinder
      to bring her up in a way that would make it easier for her to relieve the
      gratitude which I trust she will feel, not for our sakes&mdash;I hope we
      are above doing anything for the sake of the gratitude which will be given
      for it, and which is so often far beyond the worth of the thing done&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Alas! the gratitude of men
  Hath oftener left me mourning,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      said Ethel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you understand that now, my Ethel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must wish for gratitude for others&rsquo; sake, though we may be willing
      to go without it for our own. Indeed, gratitude is often just as painful
      as Wordsworth there represents it. It makes us so ashamed; makes us think
      how much more we <i>might</i> have done; how lovely a thing it is to give
      in return for such common gifts as ours; how needy the man or woman must
      be in whom a trifle awakes so much emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but we must not in justice think that it is merely that our little
      doing seems great to them: it is the kindness shown them therein, for
      which, often, they are more grateful than for the gift, though they can&rsquo;t
      show the difference in their thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, indeed, are not aware of it themselves, though it is so. And yet,
      the same remarks hold good about the kindness as about the gift. But to
      return to Theodora. If we put her in a way of life that would be
      recognisant of whence she came, and how she had been brought thence, might
      it not be better for her? Would it not be building on the truth? Would she
      not be happier for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are putting general propositions, while all the time you have
      something particular and definite in your own mind; and that is not fair
      to my place in the conference,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;In fact, you think you are
      trying to approach me wisely, in order to persuade, I will not say <i>wheedle</i>,
      me into something. It&rsquo;s a good thing you have the harmlessness of the
      dove, Harry, for you&rsquo;ve got the other thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will be as plain as ever I can be, only premising that what
      you call the cunning of the serpent&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisdom, Harry, not cunning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is only that I like to give my arguments before my proposition. But here
      it is&mdash;bare and defenceless, only&mdash;let me warn you&mdash;with a
      whole battery behind it: it is, to bring up little Theodora as a servant
      to Constance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for one who says so much about not thinking of the
      morrow, you do look rather far forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with any anxiety, however, if only I know that I am doing right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But just think: the child is about three months old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; Connie will be none the worse that she is being trained for her. I
      don&rsquo;t say that she is to commence her duties at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Connie may be at the head of a house of her own long before that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The training won&rsquo;t be lost to the child though. But I much fear, my love,
      that Connie will never be herself again. There is no sign of it. And
      Turner does not give much hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Harry, Harry, don&rsquo;t say so! I can&rsquo;t bear it. To think of the darling
      child lying like that all her life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sad, indeed; but no such awful misfortune surely, Ethel. Haven&rsquo;t
      you seen, as well as I, that the growth of that child&rsquo;s nature since her
      accident has been marvellous? Ten times rather would I have her lying
      there such as she is, than have her well and strong and silly, with her
      bonnets inside instead of outside her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but she needn&rsquo;t have been like that. Wynnie never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but God does all things not only well, but best, absolutely best.
      But just think what it would be in any circumstances to have a maid that
      had begun to wait upon her from the first days that she was able to toddle
      after something to fetch it for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be like making a slave of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be like giving her a divine freedom from the first? The lack of
      service is the ruin of humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t train her then like one of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Could we not give her all the love and all the teaching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it would not be fair to give her the education of a lady, and
      then make a servant of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that the service would be part of her training from the first;
      and she would know no change of position in it. When we tell her that she
      was found in the shrubbery, we will add that we think God sent her to take
      care of Constance. I do not believe myself that you can have perfect
      service except from a lady. Do not forget the true notion of service as
      the essence of Christianity, yea, of divinity. It is not education that
      unfits for service: it is the want of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know that the reading girls I have had, have, as a rule, served
      me worse than the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have called one of those girls educated? Or even if they had
      been educated, as any of them might well have been, better than
      nine-tenths of the girls that go to boarding-schools, you must remember
      that they had never been taught service&mdash;the highest accomplishment
      of all. To that everything aids, when any true feeling of it is there. But
      for service of this high sort, the education must begin with the beginning
      of the dawn of will. How often have you wished that you had servants who
      would believe in you, and serve you with the same truth with which you
      regarded them! The servants born in a man&rsquo;s house in the old times were
      more like his children than his servants. Here is a chance for you, as it
      were of a servant born in your own house. Connie loves the child: the
      child will love Connie, and find her delight in serving her like a little
      cherub. Not one of the maids to whom you have referred had ever been
      taught to think service other than an unavoidable necessity, the end of
      life being to serve yourself, not to serve others; and hence most of them
      would escape from it by any marriage almost that they had a chance of
      making. I don&rsquo;t say all servants are like that; but I do think that most
      of them are. I know very well that most mistresses are as much to blame
      for this result as the servants are; but we are not talking about them.
      Servants nowadays despise work, and yet are forced to do it&mdash;a most
      degrading condition to be in. But they would not be in any better
      condition if delivered from the work. The lady who despises work is in as
      bad a condition as they are. The only way to set them free is to get them
      to regard service not only as their duty, but as therefore honourable, and
      besides and beyond this, in its own nature divine. In America, the very
      name of servant is repudiated as inconsistent with human dignity. There is
      <i>no</i> dignity but of service. How different the whole notion of
      training is now from what it was in the middle ages! Service was
      honourable then. No doubt we have made progress as a whole, but in some
      things we have degenerated sadly. The first thing taught then was how to
      serve. No man could rise to the honour of knighthood without service. A
      nobleman&rsquo;s son even had to wait on his father, or to go into the family of
      another nobleman, and wait upon him as a page, standing behind his chair
      at dinner. This was an honour. No notion of degradation was in it. It was
      a necessary step to higher honour. And what was the next higher honour? To
      be set free from service? No. To serve in the harder service of the field;
      to be a squire to some noble knight; to tend his horse, to clean his
      armour, to see that every rivet was sound, every buckle true, every strap
      strong; to ride behind him, and carry his spear, and if more than one
      attacked him, to rush to his aid. This service was the more honourable
      because it was harder, and was the next step to higher honour yet. And
      what was this higher honour? That of knighthood. Wherein did this
      knighthood consist? The very word means simply <i>service</i>. And for
      what was the knight thus waited upon by his squire? That he might be free
      to do as he pleased? No, but that he might be free to be the servant of
      all. By being a squire first, the servant of one, he learned to rise to
      the higher rank, that of servant of all. His horse was tended, this armour
      observed, his sword and spear and shield held to his hand, that he might
      have no trouble looking after himself, but might be free, strong,
      unwearied, to shoot like an arrow to the rescue of any and every one who
      needed his ready aid. There was a grand heart of Christianity in that old
      chivalry, notwithstanding all its abuses which must be no more laid to its
      charge than the burning of Jews and heretics to Christianity. It was the
      lack of it, not the presence of it that occasioned the abuses that
      coexisted with it. Train our Theodora as a holy child-servant, and there
      will be no need to restrain any impulse of wise affection from pouring
      itself forth upon her. My firm belief is that we should then love and
      honour her far more than if we made her just like one of our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if she should turn out utterly unfit for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then would come an obstacle. But it will not come till that discovery
      is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if we should be going wrong all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there comes the kind of care that never troubles me, and which I so
      strongly object to. It won&rsquo;t hurt her anyhow. And we ought always to act
      upon the ideal; it is the only safe ground of action. When that which
      contradicts and resists, and would ruin our ideal, opposes us, then we
      must take measures; but not till then can we take measures, or know what
      measures it may be necessary to take. But the ideal itself is the only
      thing worth striving after. Remember what our Lord himself said: &lsquo;Be ye
      therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will think about it, Harry. There is time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plenty. No time only not to think about it. The more you think about it
      the better. If a thing be a good thing, the more you think about it the
      better it will look; for its real nature will go on coming out and showing
      itself. I cannot doubt that you will soon see how good it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We then went home. It was only two days after that my wife said to me&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more than reconciled to your plan, husband. It seems to me
      delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reentered Connie&rsquo;s room, we found that her baby had just waked,
      and she had managed to get one arm under her, and was trying to comfort
      her, for she was crying.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. A SPRING CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      More especially now in my old age, I find myself &ldquo;to a lingering motion
      bound.&rdquo; I would, if I might, tell a tale day by day, hour by hour,
      following the movement of the year in its sweet change of seasons. This
      may not be, but I will indulge myself now so far as to call this a spring
      chapter, and so pass to the summer, when my reader will see why I have
      called my story &ldquo;The Seaboard Parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was out one day amongst my people, and I found two precious things: one,
      a lovely little fact, the other a lovely little primrose. This was a
      pinched, dwarfish thing, for the spring was but a baby herself, and so
      could not mother more than a brave-hearted weakling. The frost lay all
      about it under the hedge, but its rough leaves kept it just warm enough,
      and hardly. Now, I should never have pulled the little darling; it would
      have seemed a kind of small sacrilege committed on the church of nature,
      seeing she had but this one; only with my sickly cub at home, I felt
      justified in ravening like a beast of prey. I even went so far in my greed
      as to dig up the little plant with my fingers, and bear it, leaves and
      all, with a lump of earth about it to keep it alive, home to my little
      woman&mdash;a present from the outside world which she loved so much. And
      as I went there dawned upon me the recollection of a little mirror in
      which, if I could find it, she would see it still more lovely than in a
      direct looking at itself. So I set myself to find it; for it lay in
      fragments in the drawers and cabinets of my memory. And before I got home
      I had found all the pieces and put them together; and then it was a lovely
      little sonnet which a friend of mine had written and allowed me to see
      many years before. I was in the way of writing verses myself; but I should
      have been proud to have written this one. I never could have done that.
      Yet, as far as I knew, it had never seen the light through the windows of
      print. It was with some difficulty that I got it all right; but I thought
      I had succeeded very nearly, if not absolutely, and I said it over and
      over, till I was sure I should not spoil its music or its meaning by
      halting in the delivery of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my Connie, what I have brought you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her two white, half-transparent hands, took it as if it had
      been a human baby and looked at it lovingly till the tears came in her
      eyes. She would have made a tender picture, as she then lay, with her two
      hands up, holding the little beauty before her eyes. Then I said what I
      have already written about the mirror, and repeated the sonnet to her.
      Here it is, and my readers will owe me gratitude for it. My friend had
      found the snowdrop in February, and in frost. Indeed he told me that there
      was a tolerable sprinkling of snow upon the ground:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I know not what among the grass thou art,
    Thy nature, nor thy substance, fairest flower,
    Nor what to other eyes thou hast of power
  To send thine image through them to the heart;
  But when I push the frosty leaves apart,
    And see thee hiding in thy wintry bower,
    Thou growest up within me from that hour,
  And through the snow I with the spring depart.

  I have no words. But fragrant is the breath,
    Pale Beauty, of thy second life within.
  There is a wind that cometh for thy death,
    But thou a life immortal dost begin,
  Where, in one soul, which is thy heaven, shall dwell
  Thy spirit, beautiful Unspeakable!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say it again, papa?&rdquo; said Connie; &ldquo;I do not quite understand
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, my dear. But I will do something better as well. I will go and
      write it out for you, as soon as I have given you something else that I
      have brought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, papa. And please write it in your best Sunday hand, that I may
      read it quite easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised, and repeated the poem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand it a little better,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but the meaning is just like
      the primrose itself, hidden up in its green leaves. When you give it me in
      writing, I will push them apart and find it. Now, tell me what else you
      have brought me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was greatly pleased with the resemblance the child saw between the plant
      and the sonnet; but I did not say anything in praise; I only expressed
      satisfaction. Before I began my story, Wynnie came in and sat down with
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to see Miss Aylmer, this morning,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She feels the
      loss of her mother very much, poor thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old was she, papa?&rdquo; asked Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was over ninety, my dear; but she had forgotten how much herself, and
      her daughter could not be sure about it. She was a peculiar old lady, you
      know. She once reproved me for inadvertently putting my hat on the
      tablecloth. &lsquo;Mr. Shafton,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;was one of the old school; he would
      never have done that. I don&rsquo;t know what the world is coming to.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My two girls laughed at the idea of their papa being reproved for bad
      manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say, papa?&rdquo; they asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begged her pardon, and lifted it instantly. &lsquo;O, it&rsquo;s all right now, my
      dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;when you&rsquo;ve taken it up again. But I like good manners,
      though I live in a cottage now.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had she seen better days, then?&rdquo; asked Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, and a farmer&rsquo;s widow. I suppose the chief
      difference in her mode of life was that she lived in a cottage instead of
      a good-sized farmhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the story you have to tell us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that when you have done with your questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After talking awhile, during which she went bustling a little about the
      cottage, in order to hide her feelings, as I thought, for she has a good
      deal of her mother&rsquo;s sense of dignity about her,&mdash;but I want your
      mother to hear the story. Run and fetch her, Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, do make haste, Wynnie,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ethelwyn came, I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Aylmer was bustling a little about the cottage, putting things to
      rights. All at once she gave a cry of surprise, and said, &lsquo;Here it is, at
      last!&rsquo; She had taken up a stuff dress of her mother&rsquo;s, and was holding it
      in one hand, while with the other she drew from the pocket&mdash;what do
      you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Various guesses were hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;nothing like it. I know you <i>could</i> never guess.
      Therefore it would not be fair to keep you trying. A great iron horseshoe.
      The old woman of ninety years had in the pocket of the dress that she was
      wearing at the very moment when she died, for her death was sudden, an
      iron horseshoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did it mean? Could her daughter explain it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she proceeded at once to do. &lsquo;Do you remember, sir,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;how
      that horseshoe used to hang on a nail over the chimneypiece?&rsquo; &lsquo;I do
      remember having observed it there,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;for once when I took
      notice of it, I said to your mother, laughing, &ldquo;I hope you are not afraid
      of witches, Mrs. Aylmer?&rdquo; And she looked a little offended, and assured me
      to the contrary.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; her daughter went on, &lsquo;about three months ago, I
      missed it. My mother would not tell me anything about it. And here it is!
      I can hardly think she can have carried it about all that time without me
      finding it out, but I don&rsquo;t know. Here it is, anyhow. Perhaps when she
      felt death drawing nearer, she took it from somewhere where she had hidden
      it, and put it in her pocket. If I had found it in time, I would have put
      it in her coffin.&rsquo; &lsquo;But why?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Do tell me the story about it, if
      you know it.&rsquo; &lsquo;I know it quite well, for she told me all about it once. It
      is the shoe of a favourite mare of my father&rsquo;s&mdash;one he used to ride
      when he went courting my mother. My grandfather did not like to have a
      young man coming about the house, and so he came after the old folks were
      gone to bed. But he had a long way to come, and he rode that mare. She had
      to go over some stones to get to the stable, and my mother used to spread
      straw there, for it was under the window of my grandfather&rsquo;s room, that
      her shoes mightn&rsquo;t make a noise and wake him. And that&rsquo;s one of the
      shoes,&rsquo; she said, holding it up to me. &lsquo;When the mare died, my mother
      begged my father for the one off her near forefoot, where she had so often
      stood and patted her neck when my father was mounted to ride home again.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was very naughty of her, wasn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; said Wynnie, &ldquo;to do that
      without her father&rsquo;s knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it was right, my dear. But in looking at what is wrong, we
      ought to look for the beginning of the wrong; and possibly we might find
      that in this case farther back. If, for instance, a father isn&rsquo;t a father,
      we must not be too hard in blaming the child for not being a child. The
      father&rsquo;s part has to come first, and teach the child&rsquo;s part. Now, if I
      might guess from what I know of the old lady, in whom probably it was much
      softened, her father was very possibly a hard, unreasoning, and
      unreasonable man&mdash;such that it scarcely ever came into the daughter&rsquo;s
      head that she had anything else to do with regard to him than beware of
      the consequences of letting him know that she had a lover. The whole
      thing, I allow, was wrong; but I suspect the father was first to blame,
      and far more to blame than the daughter. And that is the more likely from
      the high character of the old dame, and the romantic way in which she
      clung to the memory of the courtship. A true heart only does not grow old.
      And I have, therefore, no doubt that the marriage was a happy one.
      Besides, I daresay it was very much the custom of the country where they
      were, and that makes some difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure, papa, you wouldn&rsquo;t like any of us to go and do like
      that,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly not, my dear,&rdquo; I answered, laughing. &ldquo;Nor have I any fear of
      it. But shall I tell you what I think would be one of the chief things to
      trouble me if you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, papa. But it sounds rather dreadful to hear such an <i>if</i>&rdquo;
       said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be to think how much I had failed of being such a father to you
      as I ought to be, and as I wished to be, if it should prove at all
      possible for you to do such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dreadful to talk about, papa,&rdquo; said Wynnie; and the subject was
      dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a strange child, this Wynnie of ours. Whereas most people are in
      danger of thinking themselves in the right, or insisting that they are
      whether they think so or not, she was always thinking herself in the
      wrong. Nay more, she always expected to find herself in the wrong. If the
      perpetrator of any mischief was inquired after, she always looked into her
      own bosom to see whether she could not with justice aver that she was the
      doer of the deed. I believe she felt at that moment as if she had been
      deceiving me already, and deserved to be driven out of the house. This
      came of an over-sensitiveness, accompanied by a general dissatisfaction
      with herself, which was not upheld by a sufficient faith in the divine
      sympathy, or sufficient confidence of final purification. She never spared
      herself; and if she was a little severe on the younger ones sometimes, no
      one was yet more indulgent to them. She would eat all their hard crusts
      for them, always give them the best and take the worst for herself. If
      there was any part in the dish that she was helping that she thought
      nobody would like, she invariably assigned it to her own share. It looked
      like a determined self-mortification sometimes; but that was not it. She
      did not care for her own comfort enough to feel it any mortification;
      though I observed that when her mother or I helped her to anything nice,
      she ate it with as much relish as the youngest of the party. And her sweet
      smile was always ready to meet the least kindness that was offered her.
      Her obedience was perfect, and had been so for very many years, as far as
      we could see. Indeed, not since she was the merest child had there been
      any contest between us. Now, of course, there was no demand of obedience:
      she was simply the best earthly friend that her father and mother had. It
      often caused me some passing anxiety to think that her temperament, as
      well as her devotion to her home, might cause her great suffering some
      day; but when those thoughts came, I just gave her to God to take care of.
      Her mother sometimes said to her that she would make an excellent wife for
      a poor man. She would brighten up greatly at this, taking it for a
      compliment of the best sort. And she did not forget it, as the sequel will
      show. She would choose to sit with one candle lit when there were two on
      the table, wasting her eyes to save the candles. &ldquo;Which will you have for
      dinner to-day, papa, roast beef or boiled?&rdquo; she asked me once, when her
      mother was too unwell to attend to the housekeeping. And when I replied
      that I would have whichever she liked best&mdash;&ldquo;The boiled beef lasts
      longest, I think,&rdquo; she said. Yet she was not only as liberal and kind as
      any to the poor, but she was, which is rarer, and perhaps more important
      for the final formation of a character, carefully just to everyone with
      whom she had any dealings. Her sense of law was very strong. Law with her
      was something absolute, and not to be questioned. In her childhood there
      was one lady to whom for years she showed a decided aversion, and we could
      not understand it, for it was the most inoffensive Miss Boulderstone. When
      she was nearly grown up, one of us happening to allude to the fact, she
      volunteered an explanation. Miss Boulderstone had happened to call one day
      when Wynnie, then between three and four was in disgrace&mdash;<i>in the
      corner</i>, in fact. Miss Boulderstone interceded for her; and this was
      the whole front of her offending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>was</i> so angry!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&lsquo;As if my papa did not know best when
      I ought to come out of the corner!&rsquo; I said to myself. And I couldn&rsquo;t bear
      her for ever so long after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Boulderstone, however, though not very interesting, was quite a
      favourite before she died. She left Wynnie&mdash;for she and her brother
      were the last of their race&mdash;a death&rsquo;s-head watch, which had been in
      the family she did not know how long. I think it is as old as Queen
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s time. I took it to London to a skilful man, and had it as well
      repaired as its age would admit of; and it has gone ever since, though not
      with the greatest accuracy; for what could be expected of an old
      death&rsquo;s-head, the most transitory thing in creation? Wynnie wears it to
      this day, and wouldn&rsquo;t part with it for the best watch in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell the reader all this about my daughter that he may be the more able
      to understand what will follow in due time. He will think that as yet my
      story has been nothing but promises. Let him only hope that I will fulfil
      them, and I shall be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boulderstone did not long outlive his sister. Though the old couple,
      for they were rather old before they died, if, indeed, they were not born
      old, which I strongly suspect, being the last of a decaying family that
      had not left the land on which they were born for a great many generations&mdash;though
      the old people had not, of what the French call sentiments, one between
      them, they were yet capable of a stronger and, I had almost said, more
      romantic attachment, than many couples who have married from love; for the
      lady&rsquo;s sole trouble in dying was what her brother <i>would</i> do without
      her; and from the day of her death, he grew more and more dull and
      seemingly stupid. Nothing gave him any pleasure but having Wynnie to
      dinner with him. I knew that it must be very dull for her, but she went
      often, and I never heard her complain of it, though she certainly did look
      fagged&mdash;not <i>bored</i>, observe, but fagged&mdash;showing that she
      had been exerting herself to meet the difficulties of the situation. When
      the good man died, we found that he had left all his money in my hands, in
      trust for the poor of the parish, to be applied in any way I thought best.
      This involved me in much perplexity, for nothing is more difficult than to
      make money useful to the poor. But I was very glad of it, notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own means were not so large as my readers may think. The property my
      wife brought me was much encumbered. With the help of her private fortune,
      and the income of several years (not my income from the church, it may be
      as well to say), I succeeded in clearing off the encumbrances. But even
      then there remained much to be done, if I would be the good steward that
      was not to be ashamed at his Lord&rsquo;s coming. First of all there were many
      cottages to be built for the labourers on the estate. If the farmers would
      not, or could not, help, I must do it; for to provide decent dwellings for
      them, was clearly one of the divine conditions in the righteous tenure of
      property, whatever the human might be; for it was not for myself alone, or
      for myself chiefly, that this property was given to me; it was for those
      who lived upon it. Therefore I laid out what money I could, not only in
      getting all the land clearly in its right relation to its owner, but in
      doing the best I could for those attached to it who could not help
      themselves. And when I hint to my reader that I had some conscience in
      paying my curate, though, as they had no children, they did not require so
      much as I should otherwise have felt compelled to give them, he will
      easily see that as my family grew up I could not have so much to give away
      of my own as I should have liked. Therefore this trust of the good Mr.
      Boulderstone was the more acceptable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more ere I finish this chapter.&mdash;I should not like my
      friends to think that I had got tired of our Christmas gatherings, because
      I have made no mention of one this year. It had been pretermitted for the
      first time, because of my daughter&rsquo;s illness. It was much easier to give
      them now than when I lived at the vicarage, for there was plenty of room
      in the old hall. But my curate, Mr. Weir, still held a similar gathering
      there every Easter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another one word more about him. Some may wonder why I have not mentioned
      him or my sister, especially in connection with Connie&rsquo;s accident. The
      fact was, that he had taken, or rather I had given him, a long holiday.
      Martha had had several disappointing illnesses, and her general health had
      suffered so much in consequence that there was even some fear of her
      lungs, and a winter in the south of France had been strongly recommended.
      Upon this I came in with more than a recommendation, and insisted that
      they should go. They had started in the beginning of October, and had not
      returned up to the time of which I am now about to write&mdash;somewhere
      in the beginning of the month of April. But my sister was now almost quite
      well, and I was not sorry to think that I should soon have a little more
      leisure for such small literary pursuits as I delighted in&mdash;to my own
      enrichment, and consequently to the good of my parishioners and friends.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. AN IMPORTANT LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was, then, in the beginning of April that I received one morning an
      epistle from an old college friend of mine, with whom I had renewed my
      acquaintance of late, through the pleasure which he was kind enough to say
      he had derived from reading a little book of mine upon the relation of the
      mind of St. Paul to the gospel story. His name was Shepherd&mdash;a good
      name for a clergyman. In his case both Christian name and patronymic might
      remind him well of his duty. David Shepherd ought to be a good clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I had read the letter, I went with it open in my hand to find
      my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is Shepherd,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;with a clerical sore-throat, and forced to
      give up his duty for a whole summer. He writes to ask me whether, as he
      understands I have a curate as good as myself&mdash;that is what the old
      fellow says&mdash;it might not suit me to take my family to his place for
      the summer. He assures me I should like it, and that it would do us all
      good. His house, he says, is large enough to hold us, and he knows I
      should not like to be without duty wherever I was. And so on Read the
      letter for yourself, and turn it over in your mind. Weir will come back so
      fresh and active that it will be no oppression to him to take the whole of
      the duty here. I will run and ask Turner whether it would be safe to move
      Connie, and whether the sea-air would be good for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think you were only twenty, husband&mdash;you make up your mind
      so quickly, and are in such a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, a vision of the sea had rushed in upon me. It was many years
      since I had seen the sea, and the thought of looking on it once more, in
      its most glorious show, the Atlantic itself, with nothing between us and
      America, but the round of the ridgy water, had excited me so that my
      wife&rsquo;s reproof, if reproof it was, was quite necessary to bring me to my
      usually quiet and sober senses. I laughed, begged old grannie&rsquo;s pardon,
      and set off to see Turner notwithstanding, leaving her to read and ponder
      Shepherd&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Turner?&rdquo; I said, and told him the case. He looked
      rather grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you think of going?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the beginning of June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly two months,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;And Miss Connie was not the
      worse for getting on the sofa yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The better, I do think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she had any increase of pain since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, I quite believe; for I questioned her as to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought again. He was a careful man, although young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could make it by easy stages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would certainly do her good to breathe the sea-air and have such a
      thorough change in every way&mdash;if only it could be managed without
      fatigue and suffering. I think, if you can get her up every day between
      this and that, we shall be justified in trying it at least. The sooner you
      get her out of doors the better too; but the weather is scarcely fit for
      that yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good deal will depend on how she is inclined, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But in her case you must not mind that too much. An invalid&rsquo;s
      instincts as to eating and drinking are more to be depended upon than
      those of a healthy person; but it is not so, I think with regard to
      anything involving effort. That she must sometimes be urged to. She must
      not judge that by inclination. I have had, in my short practice, two
      patients, who considered themselves <i>bedlars</i>, as you will find the
      common people in the part you are going to, call them&mdash;bedridden,
      that is. One of them I persuaded to make the attempt to rise, and although
      her sense of inability was anything but feigned, and she will be a
      sufferer to the end of her days, yet she goes about the house without much
      inconvenience, and I suspect is not only physically but morally the better
      for it. The other would not consent to try, and I believe lies there
      still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The will has more to do with most things than people generally suppose,&rdquo;
       I said. &ldquo;Could you manage, now, do you think, supposing we resolve to make
      the experiment, to accompany us the first stage or two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very likely I could. Only you must not depend upon me. I cannot
      tell beforehand. You yourself would teach me that I must not be a
      respecter of persons, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned to my wife. She was in Connie&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of Shepherd&rsquo;s letter, of course,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been ordering the dinner since, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dinner!&rdquo; I returned with some show of contempt, for I knew my wife
      was only teasing me. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the dinner to the Atlantic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by the Atlantic, papa?&rdquo; said Connie, from whose roguish
      eyes I could see that her mother had told her all about it, and that <i>she</i>
      was not disinclined to get up, if only she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Atlantic, my dear, is the name given to that portion of the waters of
      the globe which divides Europe from America. I will fetch you the
      Universal Gazetteer, if you would like to consult it on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O papa!&rdquo; laughed Connie; &ldquo;you know what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and you know what I mean too, you squirrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you really mean, papa,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;that you will take me to the
      Atlantic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will only oblige me by getting Well enough to go as soon as
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor child half rose on her elbow, but sank back again with a moan,
      which I took for a cry of pain. I was beside her in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling! You have hurt yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, papa. I felt for the moment as if I could get up if I liked. But I
      soon found that I hadn&rsquo;t any back or legs. O! what a plague I am to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, you are the nicest plaything in the world, Connie. One
      always knows where to find you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She half laughed and half cried, and the two halves made a very bewitching
      whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I mean to try whether my dolly won&rsquo;t bear moving. One
      thing is clear, I can&rsquo;t go without it. Do you think you could be got on
      the sofa to-day without hurting you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I could, papa. I feel better today than I have felt yet. Mamma,
      do send for Susan, and get me up before dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I went in after a couple of hours or so, I found her lying on the
      conch, propped up with pillows. She lay looking out of the window on the
      lawn at the back of the house. A smile hovered about her bloodless lips,
      and the blue of her eyes, though very gray, looked sunny. Her white face
      showed the whiter because her dark brown hair was all about it. We had had
      to cut her hair, but it had grown to her neck again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to count the daisies on the lawn,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a sharp sight you must have, child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see them all as clear as if they were enamelled on that table before
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not so anxious to get rid of the daisies as some people are. Neither
      did I keep the grass quite so close shaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I could not count them, for it gave me the fidgets in
      my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me with some surprise, but concluding that I was only making
      a little of my mild fun at her expense, she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful fact?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fact, my dear, that I feel ready to go on my knees and thank God
      for. I may be wrong, but I take it as a sign that you are beginning to
      recover a little. But we mustn&rsquo;t make too much of it, lest I should be
      mistaken,&rdquo; I added, checking myself, for I feared exciting her too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she lay very still; only the tears rose slowly and lay shimmering in
      her eyes. After about five minutes, during which we were both silent,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O papa!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to think of ever walking out with you again, and
      feeling the wind on my face! I can hardly believe it possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so mild, I think you might have half that pleasure at once,&rdquo; I
      answered..
    </p>
    <p>
      And I opened the window, let the spring air gently move her hair for one
      moment, and then shut it again. Connie breathed deep, and said after a
      little pause,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea how delightful it was. To think that I have been in the way
      of breathing that every moment for so many years and never thought about
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not always just like that in this climate. But I ought not to have
      made that remark when I wanted to make this other: that I suspect we shall
      find some day that the loss of the human paradise consists chiefly in the
      closing of the human eyes; that at least far more of it than people think
      remains about us still, only we are so filled with foolish desires and
      evil cares, that we cannot see or hear, cannot even smell or taste the
      pleasant things round about us. We have need to pray in regard to the
      right receiving of the things of the senses even, &lsquo;Lord, open thou our
      hearts to understand thy word;&rsquo; for each of these things is as certainly a
      word of God as Jesus is the Word of God. He has made nothing in vain. All
      is for our teaching. Shall I tell you what such a breath of fresh air
      makes me think of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes to me,&rdquo; said Connie, &ldquo;like forgiveness when I was a little girl
      and was naughty. I used to feel just like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same kind of thing I feel,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;as if life from the
      Spirit of God were coming into my soul: I think of the wind that bloweth
      where it listeth. Wind and spirit are the same word in the Greek; and the
      Latin word <i>spirit</i> comes even nearer to what we are saying, for it
      is the wind as <i>breathed</i>. And now, Connie, I will tell you&mdash;and
      you will see how I am growing able to talk to you like quite an old friend&mdash;what
      put me in such a delight with Mr. Shepherd&rsquo;s letter and so exposed me to
      be teased by mamma and you. As I read it, there rose up before me a vision
      of one sight of the sea which I had when I was a young man, long before I
      saw your mamma. I had gone out for a walk along some high downs. But I
      ought to tell you that I had been working rather hard at Cambridge, and
      the life seemed to be all gone out of me. Though my holidays had come,
      they did not feel quite like holidays&mdash;not as holidays used to feel
      when I was a boy. Even when walking along those downs with the scents of
      sixteen grasses or so in my brain, like a melody with the odour of the
      earth for the accompaniment upon which it floated, and with just enough of
      wind to stir them up and set them in motion, I could not feel at all. I
      remembered something of what I had used to feel in such places, but
      instead of believing in that, I doubted now whether it had not been all a
      trick that I played myself&mdash;a fancied pleasure only. I was walking
      along, then, with the sea behind me. It was a warm, cloudy day&mdash;I had
      had no sunshine since I came out. All at once I turned&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
      why. There lay the gray sea, but not as I had seen it last, not all gray.
      It was dotted, spotted, and splashed all over with drops, pools, and lakes
      of light, of all shades of depth, from a light shimmer of tremulous gray,
      through a half light that turned the prevailing lead colour into
      translucent green that seemed to grow out of its depths&mdash;through
      this, I say, to brilliant light, deepening and deepening till my very soul
      was stung by the triumph of the intensity of its molten silver. There was
      no sun upon me. But there were breaks in the clouds over the sea, through
      which, the air being filled with vapour, I could see the long lines of the
      sun-rays descending on the waters like rain&mdash;so like a rain of light
      that the water seemed to plash up in light under their fall. I questioned
      the past no more; the present seized upon me, and I knew that the past was
      true, and that nature was more lovely, more awful in her loveliness than I
      could grasp. It was a lonely place: I fell on my knees, and worshipped the
      God that made the glory and my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I spoke Connie&rsquo;s tears had been flowing quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mamma and I were making fun while you were seeing such things as
      those!&rdquo; she said pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hurt them one bit, my darling&mdash;neither mamma nor you. If
      I had been the least cross about it, as I should have been when I was as
      young as at the time of which I was thinking, that would have ruined the
      vision entirely. But your merriment only made me enjoy it more. And, my
      Connie, I hope you will see the Atlantic before long; and if one vision
      should come as brilliant as that, we shall be fortunate indeed, if we went
      all the way to the west to see that only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O papa! I dare hardly think of it&mdash;it is too delightful. But do you
      think we shall really go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Here comes your mamma&mdash;I am going to say to Shepherd, my dear,
      that I will take his parish in hand, and if I cannot, after all, go
      myself, will find some one, so that he need be in no anxiety from the
      uncertainty which must hang over our movements even till the experiment
      itself is made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, husband. I am quite satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as I watched Connie, I saw that hope and expectation did much to
      prepare her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. CONNIE&rsquo;S DREAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Turner, being a good mechanic as well as surgeon, proceeded to invent,
      and with his own hands in a great measure construct, a kind of litter,
      which, with a water-bed laid upon it, could be placed in our own carriage
      for Connie to lie upon, and from that lifted, without disturbing her, and
      placed in a similar manner in the railway carriage. He had laid Connie
      repeatedly upon it before he was satisfied that the arrangement of the
      springs, &amp;c., was successful. But at length she declared that it was
      perfect, and that she would not mind being carried across the Arabian
      desert on a camel&rsquo;s back with that under her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the season advanced, she continued to improve. I shall never forget the
      first time she was carried out upon the lawn. If you can imagine an infant
      coming into the world capable of the observation and delight of a child of
      eight or ten, you will have some idea of how Connie received the new
      impressions of everything around her. They were almost too much for her at
      first, however. She who had been used to scamper about like a wild thing
      on a pony, found the delight of a breath of wind almost more than she
      could bear. After she was laid down she closed her eyes, and the smile
      that flickered about her mouth was of a sort that harmonised entirely with
      the two great tears that crept softly out from under her eyelids, and
      sank, rather than ran, down her cheeks. She lay so that she faced a rich
      tract of gently receding upland, plentifully wooded to the horizon&rsquo;s edge,
      and through the wood peeped the white and red houses of a little hamlet,
      with the square tower of its church just rising above the trees. A kind of
      frame was made to the whole picture by the nearer trees of our own woods,
      through an opening in which, evidently made or left for its sake, the
      distant prospect was visible. It was a morning in early summer, when the
      leaves were not quite full-grown but almost, and their green was shining
      and pure as the blue of the sky, when the air had no touch of bitterness
      or of lassitude, but was thoroughly warm, and yet filled the lungs with
      the reviving as of a draught of cold water. We had fastened the carriage
      umbrella to the sofa, so that it should shade her perfectly without
      obscuring her prospect; and behind this we all crept, leaving her to come
      to herself without being looked at, for emotion is a shy and sacred thing
      and should be tenderly hidden by those who are near. The bees kept very <i>beesy</i>
      all about us. To see one huge fellow, as big as three ordinary ones with
      pieces of red and yellow about him, as if he were the beadle of all
      bee-dom, and overgrown in consequence&mdash;to see him, I say, down in a
      little tuft of white clover, rolling about in it, hardly able to move for
      fatness, yet bumming away as if his business was to express the delight of
      the whole creation&mdash;was a sight! Then there were the butterflies, so
      light that they seemed to tumble up into the air, and get down again with
      difficulty. They bewildered me with their inscrutable variations of
      purpose. &ldquo;If I could but see once, for an hour, into the mind of a
      butterfly,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;it would be to me worth all the natural history I
      ever read. If I could but see why he changes his mind so often and so
      suddenly&mdash;what he saw about that flower to make him seek it&mdash;then
      why, on a nearer approach, he should decline further acquaintance with it,
      and go rocking away through the air, to do the same fifty times over again&mdash;it
      would give me an insight into all animal and vegetable life that ages of
      study could not bring me up to.&rdquo; I was thinking all this behind my
      daughter&rsquo;s umbrella, while a lark, whose body had melted quite away in the
      heavenly spaces, was scattering bright beads of ringing melody straight
      down upon our heads; while a cock was crowing like a clarion from the
      home-farm, as if in defiance of the golden glitter of his silent brother
      on the roof of the stable; while a little stream that scampered down the
      same slope as the lawn lay upon, from a well in the stable-yard, mingled
      its sweet undertone of contentment with the jubilation of the lark and the
      business-like hum of the bees; and while white clouds floated in the
      majesty of silence across the blue deeps of the heavens. The air was so
      full of life and reviving, that it seemed like the crude substance that
      God might take to make babies&rsquo; souls of&mdash;only the very simile smells
      of materialism, and therefore I do not like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Connie at length, and I was beside her in a moment. Her face
      looked almost glorified with delight: there was a hush of that awe upon it
      which is perhaps one of the deepest kinds of delight. She put out her thin
      white hand, took hold of a button of my coat, drew me down towards her,
      and said in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think God is here, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, my darling,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t <i>he</i> enjoy this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear. He wouldn&rsquo;t make us enjoy it if he did not enjoy it. It
      would be to deceive us to make us glad and blessed, while our Father did
      not care about it, or how it came to us. At least it would amount to
      making us no longer his children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you think so. I do. And I shall enjoy it so much more now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could hardly finish her sentence, but burst out sobbing so that I was
      afraid she would hurt herself. I saw, however, that it was best to leave
      her to quiet herself, and motioned to the rest to keep back and let her
      recover as she could. The emotion passed off in a summer shower, and when
      I went round once more, her face was shining just like a wet landscape
      after the sun has come out and Nature has begun to make gentle game of her
      own past sorrows. In a little while, she was merry&mdash;merrier,
      notwithstanding her weakness, than I think I had ever seen her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that comical sparrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look how he cocks his head
      first on one side and then on the other. Does he want us to see him? Is he
      bumptious, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know, my dear. I think sparrows are very like schoolboys; and I
      suspect that if we understood the one class thoroughly, we should
      understand the other. But I confess I do not yet understand either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will when Charlie and Harry are old enough to go to school,&rdquo;
       said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my only chance of making any true acquaintance with the sparrows,&rdquo;
       I answered. &ldquo;Look at them now,&rdquo; I exclaimed, as a little crowd of them
      suddenly appeared where only one had stood a moment before, and exploded
      in objurgation and general unintelligible excitement. After some obscure
      fluttering of wings and pecking, they all vanished except two, which
      walked about in a dignified manner, trying apparently to seem quite
      unconscious each of the other&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was a political meeting of some sort,&rdquo; said Connie, laughing
      merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they have this advantage over us,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;that they get
      through their business whatever it may be, with considerably greater
      expedition than we get through ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short silence followed, during which Connie lay contemplating
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think we girls are like, then, papa?&rdquo; she asked at length.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you don&rsquo;t know, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to know something more about you than I do about schoolboys. And
      I think I do know a little about girls&mdash;not much though. They puzzle
      me a good deal sometimes. I know what a great-hearted woman is, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help doing that, papa,&rdquo; interrupted Connie, adding with her old
      roguishness, &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t pass yourself off for very knowing for that. By
      the time Wynnie is quite grown up, your skill will be tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I shall understand her then, and you too, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shadow, just like the shadow of one of those white clouds above us,
      passed over her face, and she said, trying to smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never grow up, papa. If I live, I shall only be a girl at best&mdash;a
      creature you can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, Connie, I think I understand you almost as well as
      mamma. But there isn&rsquo;t so much to understand yet, you know, as there will
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her merriment returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what girls are like, then, or I shall sulk all day because you
      say there isn&rsquo;t so much in me as in mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think, if the boys are like sparrows, the girls are like
      swallows. Did you ever watch them before rain, Connie, skimming about over
      the lawn as if it were water, low towards its surface, but never
      alighting? You never see them grubbing after worms. Nothing less than
      things with wings like themselves will satisfy them. They will be obliged
      to the earth only for a little mud to build themselves nests with. For the
      rest, they live in the air, and on the creatures of the air. And then,
      when they fancy the air begins to be uncivil, sending little shoots of
      cold through their warm feathers, they vanish. They won&rsquo;t stand it.
      They&rsquo;re off to a warmer climate, and you never know till you find they&rsquo;re
      not there any more. There, Connie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, papa, whether you are making game of us or not. If you are
      not, then I wish all you say were quite true of us. If you are then I
      think it is not quite like you to be satirical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no believer in satire, Connie. And I didn&rsquo;t mean any. The swallows
      are lovely creatures, and there would be no harm if the girls were a
      little steadier than the swallows. Further satire than that I am innocent
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that much, papa. Only I&rsquo;m steady enough, and no thanks to me
      for it,&rdquo; she added with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all for the sake of your wings that you&rsquo;re kept in
      your nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not stay out long this first day, for the life the air gave her
      soon tired her weak body. But the next morning she was brighter and
      better, and longing to get up and go out again. When she was once more
      laid on her couch on the lawn, in the midst of the world of light and
      busy-ness, in which the light was the busiest of all, she said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I had such a strange dream last night: shall I tell it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, my dear. I am very fond of dreams that have any sense in
      them&mdash;or even of any that have good nonsense in them. I woke this
      morning, saying to myself, &lsquo;Dante, the poet, must have been a respectable
      man, for he was permitted by the council of Florence to carry the Nicene
      Creed and the Multiplication Table in his coat of arms.&rsquo; Now tell me your
      dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie laughed. All the household tried to make Connie laugh, and
      generally succeeded. It was quite a triumph to Charlie or Harry, and was
      sure to be recounted with glee at the next meal, when he succeeded in
      making Connie laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine wasn&rsquo;t a dream to make me laugh. It was too dreadful at first, and
      too delightful afterwards. I suppose it was getting out for the first time
      yesterday that made me dream it. I thought I was lying quite still,
      without breathing even, with my hands straight down by my sides and my
      eyes closed. I did not choose to open them, for I knew that if I did I
      should see nothing but the inside of the lid of my coffin. I did not mind
      it much at first, for I was very quiet, and not uncomfortable. Everything
      was as silent as it should be, for I was ten feet and a half under the
      surface of the earth in the churchyard. Old Sogers was not far from me on
      one side, and that was a comfort; only there was a thick wall of earth
      between. But as the time went on, I began to get uncomfortable. I could
      not help thinking how long I should have to wait for the resurrection.
      Somehow I had forgotten all that you teach us about that. Perhaps it was a
      punishment&mdash;the dream&mdash;for forgetting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly child! Your dream is far better than your reflections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go on with my dream. I lay a long time till I got very tired,
      and wanted to get up, O, so much! But still I lay, and although I tried, I
      could not move hand or foot. At last I burst out crying. I was ashamed of
      crying in my coffin, but I couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer. I thought I was
      quite disgraced, for everybody was expected to be perfectly quiet and
      patient down there. But the moment I began to cry, I heard a sound. And
      when I listened it was the sound of spades and pickaxes. It went on and
      on, and came nearer and nearer. And then&mdash;it was so strange&mdash;I
      was dreadfully frightened at the idea of the light and the wind, and of
      the people seeing me in my coffin and my night-dress, and tried to
      persuade myself that it was somebody else they were digging for, or that
      they were only going to lay another coffin over mine. And I thought that
      if it was you, papa, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind how long I lay there, for I
      shouldn&rsquo;t feel a bit lonely, even though we could not speak a word to each
      other all the time. But the sounds came on, nearer and nearer, and at last
      a pickaxe struck, with a blow that jarred me all through, upon the lid of
      the coffin, right over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here she is, poor thing!&rsquo; I heard a sweet voice say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad we&rsquo;ve found her,&rsquo; said another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer,&rsquo; said a third more pitiful voice than
      either of the others. &lsquo;I heard her first,&rsquo; it went on. &lsquo;I was away up in
      Orion, when I thought I heard a woman crying that oughtn&rsquo;t to be crying.
      And I stopped and listened. And I heard her again. Then I knew that it was
      one of the buried ones, and that she had been buried long enough, and was
      ready for the resurrection. So as any business can wait except that, I
      flew here and there till I fell in with the rest of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, papa, that this must have been because of what you were saying
      the other evening about the mysticism of St. Paul; that while he defended
      with all his might the actual resurrection of Christ and the resurrection
      of those he came to save, he used it as meaning something more yet, as a
      symbol for our coming out of the death of sin into the life of truth.
      Isn&rsquo;t that right, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear; I believe so. But I want to hear your dream first, and then
      your way of accounting for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much more of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be the best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I allow that. Well, while they spoke&mdash;it was a wonderfully
      clear and connected dream: I never had one like it for that, or for
      anything else&mdash;they were clearing away the earth and stones from the
      top of my coffin. And I lay trembling and expecting to be looked at, like
      a thing in a box as I was, every moment. But they lifted me, coffin and
      all, out of the grave, for I felt the motion of it up. Then they set it
      down, and I heard them taking the lid off. But after the lid was off, it
      did not seem to make much difference to me. I could not open my eyes. I
      saw no light, and felt no wind blowing upon me. But I heard whispering
      about me. Then I felt warm, soft hands washing my face, and then I felt
      wafts of wind coming on my face, and thought they came from the waving of
      wings. And when they had washed my eyes, the air came upon them so sweet
      and cool! and I opened them, I thought, and here I was lying on this
      couch, with butterflies and bees flitting and buzzing about me, the brook
      singing somewhere near me, and a lark up in the sky. But there were no
      angels&mdash;only plenty of light and wind and living creatures. And I
      don&rsquo;t think I ever knew before what happiness meant. Wasn&rsquo;t it a
      resurrection, papa, to come out of the grave into such a world as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it was, my darling&mdash;and a very beautiful and true dream.
      There is no need for me to moralise it to you, for you have done so for
      yourself already. But not only do I think that the coming out of sin into
      goodness, out of unbelief into faith in God, is like your dream; but I do
      expect that no dream of such delight can come up to the sense of fresh
      life and being that we shall have when we get on the higher body after
      this one won&rsquo;t serve our purpose any longer, and is worn out and cast
      aside. The very ability of the mind, whether of itself, or by some
      inspiration of the Almighty, to dream such things, is a proof of our
      capacity for such things, a proof, I think, that for such things we were
      made. Here comes in the chance for faith in God&mdash;the confidence in
      his being and perfection that he would not have made us capable without
      meaning to fill that capacity. If he is able to make us capable, that is
      the harder half done already. The other he can easily do. And if he is
      love he will do it. You should thank God for that dream, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid to do that, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as much as to fear that there is one place to which David might
      have fled, where God would not find him&mdash;the most terrible of all
      thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you mean, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreamland, my dear. If it is right to thank God for a beautiful thought&mdash;I
      mean a thought of strength and grace giving you fresh life and hope&mdash;why
      should you be less bold to thank him when such thoughts arise in plainer
      shape&mdash;take such vivid forms to your mind that they seem to come
      through the doors of the eyes into the vestibule of the brain, and thence
      into the inner chambers of the soul?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. THE JOURNEY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For more than two months Charlie and Harry had been preparing for the
      journey. The moment they heard of the prospect of it, they began to
      prepare, accumulate, and pack stores both for the transit and the sojourn.
      First of all there was an extensive preparation of ginger-beer,
      consisting, as I was informed in confidence, of brown sugar, ground
      ginger, and cold water. This store was, however, as near as I can judge,
      exhausted and renewed about twelve times before the day of departure
      arrived; and when at last the auspicious morning dawned, they remembered
      with dismay that they had drunk the last drop two days before, and there
      was none in stock. Then there was a wonderful and more successful hoarding
      of marbles, of a variety so great that my memory refuses to bear the names
      of the different kinds, which, I think, must have greatly increased since
      the time when I too was a boy, when some marbles&mdash;one of real, white
      marble with red veins especially&mdash;produced in my mind something of
      the delight that a work of art produces now. These were carefully
      deposited in one of the many divisions of a huge old hair-trunk, which
      they had got their uncle Weir, who could use his father&rsquo;s tools with
      pleasure if not to profit, to fit up for them with a multiplicity of
      boxes, and cupboards, and drawers, and trays, and slides, that was quite
      bewildering. In this same box was stowed also a quantity of hair, the
      gleanings of all the horse-tails upon the premises. This was for making
      fishing-tackle, with a vague notion on the part of Harry that it was to be
      employed in catching whales and crocodiles. Then all their favourite books
      were stowed away in the same chest, in especial a packet of a dozen penny
      books, of which I think I could give a complete list now. For one
      afternoon as I searched about in the lumber-room after a set of old
      library steps, which I wanted to get repaired, I came upon the chest, and
      opening it, discovered my boys&rsquo; hoard, and in it this packet of books. I
      sat down on the top of the chest and read them all through, from Jack the
      Giant-killer down to Hop o&rsquo; my Thumb without rising, and this in the broad
      daylight, with the yellow sunshine nestling beside me on the rose-coloured
      silken seat, richly worked, of a large stately-looking chair with three
      golden legs. Yes I could tell you all those stories, not to say the names
      of them, over yet. Only I knew every one of them before; finding now that
      they had fared like good vintages, for if they had lost something in
      potency, they had gained much in flavour. Harry could not read these, and
      Charlie not very well, but they put confidence in them notwithstanding, in
      virtue of the red, blue, and yellow prints. Then there was a box of
      sawdust, the design of which I have not yet discovered; a huge ball of
      string; a rabbit&rsquo;s skin; a Noah&rsquo;s ark; an American clock, that refused to
      go for all the variety of treatment they gave it; a box of lead-soldiers,
      and twenty other things, amongst which was a huge gilt ball having an
      eagle of brass with outspread wings on the top of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was their consternation and dismay when they found that this
      magazine could not be taken in the post-chaise in which they were to
      follow us to the station. A good part of our luggage had been sent on
      before us, but the boys had intended the precious box to go with
      themselves. Knowing well, however, how little they would miss it, and with
      what shouts of south-sea discovery they would greet the forgotten treasure
      when they returned, I insisted on the lumbering article being left in
      peace. So that, as man goeth treasureless to his grave, whatever he may
      have accumulated before the fatal moment, they had to set off for the far
      country without chest or ginger-beer&mdash;not therefore altogether so
      desolate and unprovided for as they imagined. The abandoned treasure was
      forgotten the moment the few tears it had occasioned were wiped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the loveliest of mornings when we started upon our journey. The sun
      shone, the wind was quiet, and everything was glad. The swallows were
      twittering from the corbels they had added to the adornment of the dear
      old house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to leave the swallows behind,&rdquo; said Wynnie, as she stepped into
      the carriage after her mother. Connie, of course, was already there, eager
      and strong-hearted for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set off. Connie was in delight with everything, especially with all
      forms of animal life and enjoyment that we saw on the road. She seemed to
      enter into the spirit of the cows feeding on the rich green grass of the
      meadows, of the donkeys eating by the roadside, of the horses we met
      bravely diligent at their day&rsquo;s work, as they trudged along the road with
      wagon or cart behind them. I sat by the coachman, but so that I could see
      her face by the slightest turning of my head. I knew by its expression
      that she gave a silent blessing to the little troop of a brown-faced gipsy
      family, which came out of a dingy tent to look at the passing carriage. A
      fleet of ducklings in a pool, paddling along under the convoy of the
      parent duck, next attracted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look; look. Isn&rsquo;t that delicious?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should like it though,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shouldn&rsquo;t you like, Wynnie?&rdquo; asked her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be in the water and not feel it wet. Those feathers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They feel it with their legs and their webby toes,&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is some consolation,&rdquo; answered Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you were a duck, you would feel the good of your feathers in
      winter, when you got into your cold bath of a morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I give all this chat for the sake of showing how Connie&rsquo;s illness had not
      in the least withdrawn her from nature and her sympathies&mdash;had
      rather, as it were, made all the fibres of her being more delicate and
      sympathetic, so that the things around her could enter her soul even more
      easily than before, and what had seemed to shut her out had in reality
      brought her into closer contact with the movements of all vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to pass through the village to reach the railway station. Everybody
      almost was out to bid us good-bye. I did not want, for Connie&rsquo;s sake
      chiefly, to have any scene, but recalling something I had forgotten to say
      to one of my people, I stopped the carriage to speak to him. The same
      instant there was a crowd of women about us. But Connie was the centre of
      all their regards. They hardly looked at her mother or sister. Had she
      been a martyr who had stood the test and received her aureole, she could
      hardly have been more regarded. The common use of the word martyr is a
      curious instance of how words get degraded. The sufferings involved in
      martyrdom, and not the pure will giving occasion to that suffering, is
      fixed upon by the common mind as the martyrdom. The witness-bearing is
      lost sight of, except we can suppose that &ldquo;a martyr to the toothache&rdquo;
       means a witness of the fact of the toothache and its tortures. But while
      <i>martyrdom</i> really means a bearing for the sake of the truth, yet
      there is a way in which any suffering, even that we have brought upon
      ourselves, may become martyrdom. When it is so borne that the sufferer
      therein bears witness to the presence and fatherhood of God, in quiet,
      hopeful submission to his will, in gentle endurance, and that effort after
      cheerfulness which is not seldom to be seen where the effort is hardest to
      make; more than all, perhaps, and rarest of all, when it is accepted as
      the just and merciful consequence of wrong-doing, and is endured humbly,
      and with righteous shame, as the cleansing of the Father&rsquo;s hand,
      indicating that repentance unto life which lifts the sinner out of his
      sins, and makes him such that the holiest men of old would talk to him
      with gladness and respect, then indeed it may be called a martyrdom. This
      latter could not be Connie&rsquo;s case, but the former was hers, and so far she
      might be called a martyr, even as the old women of the village designated
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had again started, our ears were invaded with shouts from the
      post-chaise behind us, in which Charlie and Harry, their grief at the
      abandoned chest forgotten as if it had never been, were yelling in the
      exuberance of their gladness. Dora, more staid as became her years, was
      trying to act the matron with them in vain, and old nursie had enough to
      do with Miss Connie&rsquo;s baby to heed what the young gentlemen were about, so
      long as explosions of noise was all the mischief. Walter, the man-servant,
      who had been with us ten years, and was the main prop of the
      establishment, looking after everything and putting his hand to
      everything, with an indefinite charge ranging from the nursery to the
      wine-cellar, and from the corn-bin to the pig-trough, and who, as we could
      not possibly get on without him, sat on the box of the post-chaise beside
      the driver from the Griffin, rather connived, I fear, than otherwise at
      the noise of the youngsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Marshmallows,&rdquo; they were shouting at the top of their voices,
      as if they had just been released from a prison, where they had spent a
      wretched childhood; and, as it could hardly offend anybody&rsquo;s ears on the
      open country road I allowed them to shout till they were tired, which
      condition fortunately arrived before we reached the station, so that there
      was no occasion for me to interfere. I always sought to give them as much
      liberty as could be afforded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the station we found Weir waiting to see us off, with my sister, now in
      wonderful health. Turner was likewise there, and ready to accompany us a
      good part of the way. But beyond the valuable assistance he lent us in
      moving Connie, no occasion arose for the exercise of his professional
      skill. She bore the journey wonderfully, slept not unfrequently, and only
      at the end showed herself at length wearied. We stopped three times on the
      way: first at Salisbury, where the streams running through the streets
      delighted her. There we remained one whole day, but sent the children and
      servants, all but my wife&rsquo;s maid, on before us, under the charge of
      Walter. This left us more at our ease. At Exeter, we stopped only the
      night, for Connie found herself quite able to go on the next morning. Here
      Turner left us, and we missed him very much. Connie looked a little out of
      spirits after his departure, but soon recovered herself. The next night we
      spent at a small town on the borders of Devonshire, which was the limit of
      our railway travelling. Here we remained for another whole day, for the
      remnant of the journey across part of Devonshire and Cornwall to the shore
      must be posted, and was a good five hours&rsquo; work. We started about eleven
      o&rsquo;clock, full of spirits at the thought that we had all but accomplished
      the only part of the undertaking about which we had had any uneasiness.
      Connie was quite merry. The air was thoroughly warm. We had an open
      carriage with a hood. Wynnie sat opposite her mother, Dora and Eliza the
      maid in the rumble, and I by the coachman. The road being very hilly, we
      had four horses; and with four horses, sunshine, a gentle wind, hope and
      thankfulness, who would not be happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a strange delight in motion, which I am not sure that I
      altogether understand. The hope of the end as bringing fresh enjoyment has
      something to do with it, no doubt; the accompaniments of the motion, the
      change of scene, the mystery that lies beyond the next hill or the next
      turn in the road, the breath of the summer wind, the scent of the
      pine-trees especially, and of all the earth, the tinkling jangle of the
      harness as you pass the trees on the roadside, the life of the horses, the
      glitter and the shadow, the cottages and the roses and the rosy faces, the
      scent of burning wood or peat from the chimneys, these and a thousand
      other things combine to make such a journey delightful. But I believe it
      needs something more than this&mdash;something even closer to the human
      life&mdash;to account for the pleasure that motion gives us. I suspect it
      is its living symbolism; the hidden relations which it bears to the
      eternal soul in its aspirations and longings&mdash;ever following after,
      ever attaining, never satisfied. Do not misunderstand me, my reader. A
      man, you will allow, perhaps, may be content although he is not and cannot
      be happy: I feel inclined to turn all this the other way, saying that a
      man ought always to be happy, never to be content. You will see I do not
      say <i>contented</i>; I say <i>content</i>. Here comes in his faith: his
      life is hid with Christ in God, measureless, unbounded. All things are
      his, to become his by blessed lovely gradations of gift, as his being
      enlarges to receive; and if ever the shadow of his own necessary
      incompleteness falls upon the man, he has only to remember that in God&rsquo;s
      idea he is complete, only his life is hid from himself with Christ in God
      the Infinite. If anyone accuses me here of mysticism, I plead guilty with
      gladness: I only hope it may be of that true mysticism which, inasmuch as
      he makes constant use of it, St. Paul would understand at once. I leave
      it, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I must have been the very happiest of the party myself. No doubt I
      was younger much than I am now, but then I was quite middle-aged, with
      full confession thereof in gray hairs and wrinkles. Why should not a man
      be happy when he is growing old, so long as his faith strengthens the
      feeble knees which chiefly suffer in the process of going down the hill?
      True, the fever heat is over, and the oil burns more slowly in the lamp of
      life; but if there is less fervour, there is more pervading warmth; if
      less of fire, more of sunshine; there is less smoke and more light.
      Verily, youth is good, but old age is better&mdash;to the man who forsakes
      not his youth when his youth forsakes him. The sweet visitings of nature
      do not depend upon youth or romance, but upon that quiet spirit whose
      meekness inherits the earth. The smell of that field of beans gives me
      more delight now than ever it could have given me when I was a youth. And
      if I ask myself why I find it is simply because I have more faith now than
      I had then. It came to me then as an accident of nature&mdash;a passing
      pleasure flung to me only as the dogs&rsquo; share of the crumbs. Now I believe
      that God <i>means</i> that odour of the bean-field; that when Jesus
      smelled such a scent about Jerusalem or in Galilee, he thought of his
      Father. And if God means it, it is mine, even if I should never smell it
      again. The music of the spheres is mine if old age should make me deaf as
      the adder. Am I mystical again, reader? Then I hope you are too, or will
      be before you have done with this same beautiful mystical life of ours.
      More and more nature becomes to me one of God&rsquo;s books of poetry&mdash;not
      his grandest&mdash;that is history&mdash;but his loveliest, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      And ought I not to have been happy when all who were with me were happy? I
      will not run the risk of wearying even my contemplative reader by
      describing to him the various reflexes of happiness that shone from the
      countenances behind me in the carriage, but I will try to hit each off in
      a word, or a single simile. My Ethelwyn&rsquo;s face was bright with the
      brightness of a pale silvery moon that has done her harvest work, and, a
      little weary, lifts herself again into the deeper heavens from stooping
      towards the earth. Wynnie&rsquo;s face was bright with the brightness of the
      morning star, ever growing pale and faint over the amber ocean that
      brightens at the sun&rsquo;s approach; for life looked to Wynnie severe in its
      light, and somewhat sad because severe. Connie&rsquo;s face was bright with the
      brightness of a lake in the rosy evening, the sound of the river flowing
      in and the sound of the river flowing forth just audible, but itself
      still, and content to be still and mirror the sunset. Dora&rsquo;s was bright
      with the brightness of a marigold that follows the sun without knowing it;
      and Eliza&rsquo;s was bright with the brightness of a half-blown cabbage rose,
      radiating good-humour. This last is not a good simile, but I cannot find a
      better. I confess failure, and go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      After stopping once to bait, during which operation Connie begged to be
      carried into the parlour of the little inn that she might see the china
      figures that were certain to be on the chimney-piece, as indeed they were,
      where she drank a whole tumbler of new milk before we lifted her to carry
      her back, we came upon a wide high moorland country the roads through
      which were lined with gorse in full golden bloom, while patches of heather
      all about were showing their bells, though not yet in their autumnal
      outburst of purple fire. Here I began to be reminded of Scotland, in which
      I had travelled a good deal between the ages of twenty and
      five-and-twenty. The further I went the stronger I felt the resemblance.
      The look of the fields, the stone fences that divided them, the shape and
      colour and materials of the houses, the aspect of the people, the feeling
      of the air, and of the earth and sky generally, made me imagine myself in
      a milder and more favoured Scotland. The west wind was fresh, but had none
      of that sharp edge which one can so often detect in otherwise warm winds
      blowing under a hot sun. Though she had already travelled so many miles,
      Connie brightened up within a few minutes after we got on this moor; and
      we had not gone much farther before a shout from the rumble informed us
      that keen-eyed little Dora had discovered the Atlantic: a dip in the high
      coast revealed it blue and bright. We soon lost sight of it again, but in
      Connie&rsquo;s eyes it seemed to linger still. As often as I looked round, the
      blue of them seemed the reflection of the sea in their little convex
      mirrors. Ethelwyn&rsquo;s eyes, too, were full of it, and a flush on her
      generally pale cheek showed that she too expected the ocean. After a few
      miles along this breezy expanse, we began to descend towards the
      sea-level. Down the winding of a gradual slope, interrupted by steep
      descents, we approached this new chapter in our history. We came again
      upon a few trees here and there, all with their tops cut off in a plane
      inclined upwards away from the sea. For the sea-winds, like a sweeping
      scythe, bend the trees all away towards the land, and keep their tops mown
      with their sharp rushing, keen with salt spray off the crests of the
      broken waves. Then we passed through some ancient villages, with streets
      narrow, and steep and sharp-angled, that needed careful driving and the
      frequent pressure of the break upon the wheel. And now the sea shone upon
      us with nearer greeting, and we began to fancy we could hear its talk with
      the shore. At length we descended a sharp hill, reached the last level,
      drove over a bridge and down the line of the stream, saw the land vanish
      in the sea&mdash;a wide bay; then drove over another wooden drawbridge,
      and along the side of a canal in which lay half-a-dozen sloops and
      schooners. Then came a row of pretty cottages; then a gate, and an ascent,
      and ere we reached the rectory, we were aware of its proximity by loud
      shouts, and the sight of Charlie and Harry scampering along the top of a
      stone wall to meet us. This made their mother nervous, but she kept quiet,
      knowing that unrestrained anxiety is always in danger of bringing about
      the evil it fears. A moment after, we drew up at a long porch, leading
      through the segment of a circle to the door of the house. The journey was
      over. We got down in the little village of Kilkhaven, in the county of
      Cornwall.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. WHAT WE DID WHEN WE ARRIVED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We carried Connie in first of all, of course, and into the room which
      nurse had fixed upon for her&mdash;the best in the house, of course,
      again. She did seem tired now, and no wonder. She had a cup of tea at
      once, and in half an hour dinner was ready, of which we were all very
      glad. After dinner I went up to Connie&rsquo;s room. There I found her fast
      asleep on the sofa, and Wynnie as fast asleep on the floor beside her. The
      drive and the sea air had had the same effect on both of them. But pleased
      as I was to see Connie sleeping so sweetly, I was even more pleased to see
      Wynnie asleep on the floor. What a wonderful satisfaction it may give to a
      father and mother to see this or that child asleep! It is when her kittens
      are asleep that the cat creeps away to look after her own comforts. Our
      cat chose to have her kittens in my study once, and as I would not have
      her further disturbed than to give them another cushion to lie on in place
      of that which belonged to my sofa, I had many opportunities of watching
      them as I wrote, or prepared my sermons. But I must not talk about the cat
      and her kittens now. When parents see their children asleep, especially if
      they have been suffering in any way, they breathe more freely; a load is
      lifted off their minds; their responsibility seems over; the children have
      gone back to their Father, and he alone is looking after them for a while.
      Now, I had not been comfortable about Wynnie for some time, and especially
      during our journey, and still more especially during the last part of our
      journey. There was something amiss with her. She seemed constantly more or
      less dejected, as if she had something to think about that was too much
      for her, although, to tell the truth, I really believe now that she had
      not quite enough to think about. Some people can thrive tolerably without
      much thought: at least, they both live comfortably without it, and do not
      seem to be capable of effecting it if it were required of them; while for
      others a large amount of mental and spiritual operation is necessary for
      the health of both body and mind, and when the matter or occasion for so
      much is not afforded them, the consequence is analogous to what follows
      when a healthy physical system is not supplied with sufficient food: the
      oxygen, the source of life, begins to consume the life itself; it tears up
      the timbers of the house to burn against the cold. Or, to use a different
      simile, when the Moses-rod of circumstance does not strike the rock and
      make the waters flow, such a mind&mdash;one that must think to live&mdash;will
      go digging into itself, and is in danger of injuring the very fountain of
      thought, by drawing away its living water into ditches and stagnant pools.
      This was, I say, the case in part with my Wynnie, although I did not
      understand it at that moment. She did not look quite happy, did not always
      meet a smile with a smile, looked almost reprovingly upon the frolics of
      the little brother-imps, and though kindness itself when any real hurt or
      grief befell them, had reverted to her old, somewhat dictatorial manner,
      of which I have already spoken as interrupted by Connie&rsquo;s accident. To her
      mother and me she was service itself, only service without the smile which
      is as the flame of the sacrifice and makes it holy. So we were both a
      little uneasy about her, for we did not understand her. On the journey she
      had seemed almost annoyed at Connie&rsquo;s ecstasies, and said to Dora many
      times: &ldquo;Do be quiet, Dora;&rdquo; although there was not a single creature but
      ourselves within hearing, and poor Connie seemed only delighted with the
      child&rsquo;s explosions. So I was&mdash;but although I say <i>so</i>, I hardly
      know why I was pleased to see her thus, except it was from a vague belief
      in the anodyne of slumber. But this pleasure did not last long; for as I
      stood regarding my two treasures, even as if my eyes had made her
      uncomfortable, she suddenly opened hers, and started to her feet, with the
      words, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, papa,&rdquo; looking almost guiltily round her, and
      putting up her hair hurriedly, as if she had committed an impropriety in
      being caught untidy. This was fresh sign of a condition of mind that was
      not healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what do you beg my pardon for? I was so pleased to see
      you asleep! and you look as if you thought I were going to scold you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O papa,&rdquo; she said, laying her head on my shoulder, &ldquo;I am afraid I must be
      very naughty. I so often feel now as if I were doing something wrong, or
      rather as if you would think I was doing something wrong. I am sure there
      must be something wicked in me somewhere, though I do not clearly know
      what it is. When I woke up now, I felt as if I had neglected something,
      and you had come to find fault with me. <i>Is</i> there anything, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever, my child. But you cannot be well when you feel like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am perfectly well, so far as I know. I was so cross to Dora to-day! Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I feel happy when everybody else is? I must be wicked, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Connie woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now! I&rsquo;ve waked Connie,&rdquo; Wynnie resumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always doing
      something I ought not to do. Please go to sleep again, Connie, and take
      that sin off my poor conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense is Wynnie talking about being wicked?&rdquo; asked Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nonsense, Connie. You know I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of the sort, Wynnie. If it were me now! And yet I don&rsquo;t <i>feel</i>
      wicked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear children,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we must all pray to God for his Spirit, and
      then we shall feel just as we ought to feel. It is not for anyone to say
      to himself how he ought to feel at any given moment; still less for one
      man to say to another how he ought to feel; that is in the former case to
      do as St. Paul says he had learned to give up doing&mdash;to judge our own
      selves, which ought to be left to God; in the latter case it is to do what
      our Lord has told us expressly we are not to do&mdash;to judge other
      people. You get your bonnet, Wynnie, and come out with me. I am going to
      explore a little of this desert island upon which we have been cast away.
      And you, Connie, just to please Wynnie, must try and go to sleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie ran for her bonnet, a little afraid perhaps that I was going to
      talk seriously to her, but showing no reluctance anyhow to accompany me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I wonder whether it will be better to tell what we saw, or only what
      we talked about, and give what we saw in the shape in which we reported it
      to Connie, when we came back into her room, bearing, like the spies who
      went to search the land, our bunch of grapes, that is, of sweet news of
      nature, to her who could not go to gather them for herself. It think it
      will be the best plan to take part of both plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we left the door of the house, we went up the few steps of a stair
      leading on to the downs, against and amidst, and indeed <i>in</i>, the
      rocks, buttressing the sea-edge of which our new abode was built. A life
      for a big-winged angel seemed waiting us upon those downs. The wind still
      blew from the west, both warm and strong&mdash;I mean strength-giving&mdash;and
      the wind was the first thing we were aware of. The ground underfoot was
      green and soft and springy, and sprinkled all over with the bright
      flowers, chiefly yellow, that live amidst the short grasses of the downs,
      the shadows of whose unequal surface were now beginning to be thrown east,
      for the sun was going seawards. I stood up, stretched out my arms, threw
      back my shoulders and my head, and filled my chest with a draught of the
      delicious wind, feeling thereafter like a giant refreshed with wine.
      Wynnie stood apparently unmoved amidst the life-nectar, thoughtful, and
      turning her eyes hither and thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes me feel young again,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it would make me feel old then,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because then I should have a chance of knowing what it is like to feel
      young,&rdquo; she answered rather enigmatically. I did not reply. We were
      walking up the brow which hid the sea from us. The smell of the down-turf
      was indescribable in its homely delicacy; and by the time we had reached
      the top, almost every sense was filled with its own delight. The top of
      the hill was the edge of the great shore-cliff; and the sun was hanging on
      the face of the mightier sky-cliff opposite, and the sea stretched for
      visible miles and miles along the shore on either hand, its wide blue
      mantle fringed with lovely white wherever it met the land, and scalloped
      into all fantastic curves, according to the whim of the nether fires which
      had formed its bed; and the rush of the waves, as they bore the rising
      tide up on the shore, was the one music fit for the whole. Ear and eye,
      touch and smell, were alike invaded with blessedness. I ought to have kept
      this to give my reader in Connie&rsquo;s room; but he shall share with her
      presently. The sense of space&mdash;of mighty room for life and growth&mdash;filled
      my soul, and I thanked God in my heart. The wind seemed to bear that
      growth into my soul, even as the wind of God first breathed into man&rsquo;s
      nostrils the breath of life, and the sun was the pledge of the fulfilment
      of every aspiration. I turned and looked at Wynnie. She stood pleased but
      listless amidst that which lifted me into the heaven of the Presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you enjoy all this grandeur, Wynnie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I was very wicked, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I told you not to say so, Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I cannot enjoy it, papa. I wonder why it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect it is because you haven&rsquo;t room, Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you mean something more than I know, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, my dear, that it is not because you are wicked, but because you
      do not know God well enough, and therefore your being, which can only live
      in him, is &lsquo;cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in.&rsquo; It is only in him that
      the soul has room. In knowing him is life and its gladness. The secret of
      your own heart you can never know; but you can know Him who knows its
      secret. Look up, my darling; see the heavens and the earth. You do not
      feel them, and I do not call upon you to feel them. It would be both
      useless and absurd to do so. But just let them look at you for a moment,
      and then tell me whether it must not be a blessed life that creates such a
      glory as this All.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood silent for a moment, looked up at the sky, looked round on the
      earth, looked far across the sea to the setting sun, and then turned her
      eyes upon me. They were filled with tears, but whether from feeling, or
      sorrow that she could not feel, I would not inquire. I made haste to speak
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As this world of delight surrounds and enters your bodily frame, so does
      God surround your soul and live in it. To be at home with the awful source
      of your being, through the child-like faith which he not only permits, but
      requires, and is ever teaching you, or rather seeking to rouse up in you,
      is the only cure for such feelings as those that trouble you. Do not say
      it is too high for you. God made you in his own image, therefore capable
      of understanding him. For this final end he sent his Son, that the Father
      might with him come into you, and dwell with you. Till he does so, the
      temple of your soul is vacant; there is no light behind the veil, no
      cloudy pillar over it; and the priests, your thoughts, feelings, loves,
      and desires, moan, and are troubled&mdash;for where is the work of the
      priest when the God is not there? When He comes to you, no mystery, no
      unknown feeling, will any longer distress you. You will say, &lsquo;He knows,
      though I do not.&rsquo; And you will be at the secret of the things he has made.
      You will feel what they are, and that which his will created in gladness
      you will receive in joy. One glimmer of the present God in this glory
      would send you home singing. But do not think I blame you, Wynnie, for
      feeling sad. I take it rather as the sign of a large life in you, that
      will not be satisfied with little things. I do not know when or how it may
      please God to give you the quiet of mind that you need; but I tell you
      that I believe it is to be had; and in the mean time, you must go on doing
      your work, trusting in God even for this. Tell him to look at your sorrow,
      ask him to come and set it right, making the joy go up in your heart by
      his presence. I do not know when this may be, I say, but you must have
      patience, and till he lays his hand on your head, you must be content to
      wash his feet with your tears. Only he will be better pleased if your
      faith keep you from weeping and from going about your duties mournful. Try
      to be brave and cheerful for the sake of Christ, and for the sake of your
      confidence in the beautiful teaching of God, whose course and scope you
      cannot yet understand. Trust, my daughter, and let that give you courage
      and strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the sky and the sea and the earth must have made me able to say these
      things to her; but I knew that, whatever the immediate occasion of her
      sadness, such was its only real cure. Other things might, in virtue of the
      will of God that was in them, give her occupation and interest enough for
      a time, but nothing would do finally, but God himself. Here I was sure I
      was safe; here I knew lay the hunger of humanity. Humanity may, like other
      vital forms, diseased systems, fix on this or that as the object not
      merely of its desire but of its need: it can never be stilled by less than
      the bread of life&mdash;the very presence in the innermost nature of the
      Father and the Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked on together. Wynnie made me no reply, but, weeping silently,
      clung to my arm. We walked a long way by the edge of the cliffs, beheld
      the sun go down, and then turned and went home. When we reached the house,
      Wynnie left me, saying only, &ldquo;Thank you, papa. I think it is all true. I
      will try to be a better girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went straight to Connie&rsquo;s room: she was lying as I saw her last, looking
      out of her window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Wynnie and I have had such a treat&mdash;such a
      sunset!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a little of the light of it on the waves in the bay there, but
      the high ground kept me from seeing the sunset itself. Did it set in the
      sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do want the General Gazetteer, after all, Connie. Is that water the
      Atlantic, or is it not? And if it be, where on earth could the sun set but
      in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, papa. What a goose I am! But don&rsquo;t make game of me&mdash;<i>please</i>.
      I am too deliciously happy to be made game of to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make game of you, my darling. I will tell you about the sunset&mdash;the
      colours of it, at least. This must be one of the best places in the whole
      world to see sunsets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have had no tea, papa. I thought you would come and have your tea
      with me. But you were so long, that mamma would not let me wait any
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, never mind the tea, my dear. But Wynnie has had none. You&rsquo;ve got a
      tea-caddy of your own, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a teapot; and there&rsquo;s the kettle on the hob&mdash;for I can&rsquo;t do
      without a little fire in the evenings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make some tea for Wynnie and myself, and tell you at the same
      time about the sunset. I never saw such colours. I cannot tell you what it
      was like while the sun was yet going down, for the glory of it has burned
      the memory of it out of me. But after the sun was down, the sky remained
      thinking about him; and the thought of the sky was in delicate translucent
      green on the horizon, just the colour of the earth etherealised and
      glorified&mdash;a broad band; then came another broad band of pale
      rose-colour; and above that came the sky&rsquo;s own eternal blue, pale
      likewise, but so sure and changeless. I never saw the green and the blue
      divided and harmonised by the rose-colour before. It was a wonderful
      sight. If it is warm enough to-morrow, we will carry you out on the
      height, that you may see what the evening will bring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing about sunsets,&rdquo; returned Connie&mdash;&ldquo;two things,
      that make me rather sad&mdash;about themselves, not about anything else.
      Shall I tell you them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, my love. There are few things more precious to learn than the effects
      of Nature upon individual minds. And there is not a feeling of yours, my
      child, that is not of value to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so kind, papa! I am so glad of my accident. I think I should
      never have known how good you are but for that. But my thoughts seem so
      little worth after you say so much about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me be judge of that, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one thing is, that we shall never, never, never, see the same
      sunset again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. But why should we? God does not care to do the same thing
      over again. When it is once done, it is done, and he goes on doing
      something new. For, to all eternity, he never will have done showing
      himself by new, fresh things. It would be a loss to do the same thing
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that just brings me to my second trouble. The thing is lost. I forget
      it. Do what I can, I cannot remember sunsets. I try to fix them fast in my
      memory, that I may recall them when I want them; but just as they fade out
      of the sky, all into blue or gray, so they fade out of my mind and leave
      it as if they had never been there&mdash;except perhaps two or three. Now,
      though I did not see this one, yet, after you have talked about it, I
      shall never forget <i>it</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not, and never will be, as if they had never been. They have their
      influence, and leave that far deeper than your memory&mdash;in your very
      being, Connie. But I have more to say about it, although it is only an
      idea, hardly an assurance. Our brain is necessarily an imperfect
      instrument. For its right work, perhaps it is needful that it should
      forget in part. But there are grounds for believing that nothing is ever
      really forgotten. I think that, when we have a higher existence than we
      have now, when we are clothed with that spiritual body of which St. Paul
      speaks, you will be able to recall any sunset you have ever seen with an
      intensity proportioned to the degree of regard and attention you gave it
      when it was present to you. But here comes Wynnie to see how you are.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
      been making some tea for you, Wynnie, my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, thank you, papa&mdash;I shall be so glad of some tea!&rdquo; said Wynnie,
      the paleness of whose face showed the red rims of her eyes the more
      plainly. She had had what girls call a good cry, and was clearly the
      better for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same moment my wife came in. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send for me, Harry, to
      get your tea?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not deserve any, seeing I had disregarded proper times and seasons.
      But I knew you must be busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been superintending the arrangement of bedrooms, and the
      unpacking, and twenty different things,&rdquo; said Ethelwyn. &ldquo;We shall be so
      comfortable! It is such a curious house! Have you had a nice walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I never had such a walk in my life,&rdquo; returned Wynnie. &ldquo;You would
      think the shore had been built for the sake of the show&mdash;just for a
      platform to see sunsets from. And the sea! Only the cliffs will be rather
      dangerous for the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been telling Connie about the sunset. She could see something
      of the colours on the water, but not much more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Connie, it will be so delightful to get you out here! Everything is so
      big! There is such room everywhere! But it must be awfully windy in
      winter,&rdquo; said Wynnie, whose nature was always a little prospective, if not
      apprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must not keep my reader longer upon mere family chat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. MORE ABOUT KILKHAVEN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our dining-room was one story below the level at which we had entered the
      parsonage; for, as I have said, the house was built into the face of the
      cliff, just where it sunk nearly to the level of the shores of the bay.
      While at dinner, on the evening of our arrival, I kept looking from the
      window, of course, and I saw before me, first a little bit of garden,
      mostly in turf, then a low stone wall; beyond, over the top of the wall,
      the blue water of the bay; then beyond the water, all alive with light and
      motion, the rocks and sand-hills of the opposite side of the little bay,
      not a quarter of a mile across. I could likewise see where the shore went
      sweeping out and away to the north, with rock after rock standing far into
      the water, as if gazing over the awful wild, where there was nothing to
      break the deathly waste between Cornwall and Newfoundland. But for the
      moment I did not regard the huge power lying outside so much as the merry
      blue bay between me and those rocks and sand-hills. If I moved my head a
      little to the right, I saw, over the top of the low wall already
      mentioned, and apparently quite close to it the slender yellow masts of a
      schooner, her mainsail hanging loose from the gaff, whose peak was
      lowered. We must, I thought, be on the very harbour-quay. When I went out
      for my walk with Wynnie, I had turned from the bay, and gone to the brow
      of the cliffs overhanging the open sea on our own side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came down to breakfast in the same room next morning, I stared. The
      blue had changed to yellow. The life of the water was gone. Nothing met my
      eyes but a wide expanse of dead sand. You could walk straight across the
      bay to the hills opposite. From the look of the rocks, from the
      perpendicular cliffs on the coast, I had almost, without thinking,
      concluded that we were on the shore of a deep-water bay. It was
      high-water, or nearly so, then; and now, when I looked westward, it was
      over a long reach of sands, on the far border of which the white fringe of
      the waves was visible, as if there was their <i>hitherto</i>, and further
      towards us they could not come. Beyond the fringe lay the low hill of the
      Atlantic. To add to my confusion, when I looked to the right, that is, up
      the bay towards the land, there was no schooner there. I went out at the
      window, which opened from the room upon the little lawn, to look, and then
      saw in a moment how it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear,&rdquo; I said to my wife, &ldquo;we are just at the mouth of
      that canal we saw as we came along? There are gates and a lock just
      outside there. The schooner that was under this window last night must
      have gone in with the tide. She is lying in the basin above now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, papa,&rdquo; Charlie and Harry broke in together. &ldquo;We saw it go up this
      morning. We&rsquo;ve been out ever so long. It was so funny,&rdquo; Charlie went on&mdash;everything
      was <i>funny</i> with Charlie&mdash;&ldquo;to see it rise up like a
      Jack-in-the-box, and then slip into the quiet water through the other
      gates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when I thought about the waves tumbling and breaking away out there,
      and the wide yellow sands between, it was wonderful&mdash;which was what
      Charlie meant by funny&mdash;to see the little vessel lying so many feet
      above it all, in a still plenty of repose, gathering strength, one might
      fancy to rush out again, when its time was come, into the turmoil beyond,
      and dash its way through the breasts of the billows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast we had prayers, as usual, and after a visit to Connie,
      whom I found tired, but wonderfully well, I went out for a walk by myself,
      to explore the neighbourhood, find the church, and, in a word, do
      something to shake myself into my new garments. The day was glorious. I
      wandered along a green path, in the opposite direction from our walk the
      evening before, with a fir-wood on my right hand, and a belt of feathery
      tamarisks on my left, behind which lay gardens sloping steeply to a lower
      road, where stood a few pretty cottages. Turning a corner, I came suddenly
      in sight of the church, on the green down above me&mdash;a sheltered yet
      commanding situation; for, while the hill rose above it, protecting it
      from the east, it looked down the bay, and the Atlantic lay open before
      it. All the earth seemed to lie behind it, and all its gaze to be fixed on
      the symbol of the infinite. It stood as the church ought to stand, leading
      men up the mount of vision, to the verge of the eternal, to send them back
      with their hearts full of the strength that springs from hope, by which
      alone the true work of the world can be done. And when I saw it I rejoiced
      to think that once more I was favoured with a church that had a history.
      Of course it is a happy thing to see new churches built wherever there is
      need of such; but to the full idea of the building it is necessary that it
      should be one in which the hopes and fears, the cares and consolations,
      the loves and desires of our forefathers should have been roofed; where
      the hearts of those through whom our country has become that which it is&mdash;from
      whom not merely the life-blood of our bodies, but the life-blood of our
      spirits, has come down to us, whose existence and whose efforts have made
      it possible for us to be that which we are&mdash;have before us worshipped
      that Spirit from whose fountain the whole torrent of being flows, who ever
      pours fresh streams into the wearying waters of humanity, so ready to
      settle down into a stagnant repose. Therefore I would far rather, when I
      may, worship in an old church, whose very stones are a history of how men
      strove to realise the infinite, compelling even the powers of nature into
      the task&mdash;as I soon found on the very doorway of this church, where
      the ripples of the outspread ocean, and grotesque imaginations of the
      monsters of its deeps, fixed, as it might seem, for ever in stone, gave a
      distorted reflex, from the little mirror of the artist&rsquo;s mind, of that
      mighty water, so awful, so significant to the human eye, which yet lies in
      the hollow of the Father&rsquo;s palm, like the handful that the weary traveller
      lifts from the brook by the way. It is in virtue of the truth that went
      forth in such and such like attempts that we are able to hold our portion
      of the infinite reality which God only knows. They have founded our Church
      for us, and such a church as this will stand for the symbol of it; for
      here we too can worship the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob&mdash;the
      God of Sidney, of Hooker, of Herbert. This church of Kilkhaven, old and
      worn, rose before me a history in stone&mdash;so beaten and swept about by
      the &ldquo;wild west wind,&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;For whose path the Atlantic&rsquo;s level powers
  Cleave themselves into chasms,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and so streamed upon, and washed, and dissolved, by the waters lifted from
      the sea and borne against it on the upper tide of the wind, that you could
      almost fancy it one of those churches that have been buried for ages
      beneath the encroaching waters, lifted again, by some mighty revulsion of
      nature&rsquo;s heart, into the air of the sweet heavens, there to stand marked
      for ever with the tide-flows of the nether world&mdash;scooped, and
      hollowed, and worn like aeonian rocks that have slowly, but for ever,
      responded to the swirl and eddy of the wearing waters. So, from the most
      troublous of times, will the Church of our land arise, in virtue of what
      truth she holds, and in spite, if she rises at all, of the worldliness of
      those who, instead of seeking her service, have sought and gained the
      dignities which, if it be good that she have it in her power to bestow
      them, need the corrective of a sharply wholesome persecution which of late
      times she has not known. But God knows, and the fire will come in its
      course&mdash;first in the form of just indignation, it may be, against her
      professed servants, and then in the form of the furnace seven times
      heated, in which the true builders shall yet walk unhurt save as to their
      mortal part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked about for some cottage where the sexton might be supposed to
      live, and spied a slated roof, nearly on a level with the road, at a
      little distance in front of me. I could at least inquire there. Before I
      reached it, however, an elderly woman came out and approached me. She was
      dressed in a white cap and a dark-coloured gown. On her face lay a certain
      repose which attracted me. She looked as if she had suffered but had
      consented to it, and therefore could smile. Her smile lay near the
      surface. A kind word was enough to draw it up from the well where it lay
      shimmering: you could always see the smile there, whether it was born or
      not. But even when she smiled, in the very glimmering of that moonbeam,
      you could see the deep, still, perhaps dark, waters under. O! if one could
      but understand what goes on in the souls that have no words, perhaps no
      inclination, to set it forth! What had she endured? How had she learned to
      have that smile always near? What had consoled her, and yet left her her
      grief&mdash;turned it, perhaps, into hope? Should I ever know?
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew near me, as if she would have passed me, as she would have done,
      had I not spoken. I think she came towards me to give me the opportunity
      of speaking if I wished, but she would not address me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Can you tell me where to find the sexton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she answered, with a gleam of the smile brightening
      underneath her old skin, as it were, &ldquo;I be all the sexton you be likely to
      find this mornin&rsquo;, sir. My husband, he be gone out to see one o&rsquo; Squire
      Tregarva&rsquo;s hounds as was took ill last night. So if you want to see the
      old church, sir, you&rsquo;ll have to be content with an old woman to show you,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be quite content, I assure you,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Will you go and get
      the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the key in my pocket, sir; for I thought that would be what you&rsquo;d
      be after, sir. And by the time you come to my age, sir, you&rsquo;ll learn to
      think of your old bones, sir. I beg your pardon for making so free. For
      mayhap, says I to myself, he be the gentleman as be come to take Mr.
      Shepherd&rsquo;s duty for him. Be ye now, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was said in a slow sweet subdued tone, nearly of one pitch. You
      would have felt that she claimed the privilege of age with a kind of
      mournful gaiety, but was careful, and anxious even, not to presume upon
      it, and, therefore, gentle as a young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;My name is Walton I have come to take the place of my
      friend Mr. Shepherd; and, of course, I want to see the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she be a bee-utiful old church. Some things, I think, sir, grows
      more beautiful the older they grows. But it ain&rsquo;t us, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, there&rsquo;s my little grandson in the cottage there: he&rsquo;ll never
      be so beautiful again. Them children du be the loves. But we all grows
      uglier as we grows older. Churches don&rsquo;t seem to, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about all that,&rdquo; I said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did say, sir, that I was a pretty girl once. I&rsquo;m not much to look at
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she smiled with such a gracious amusement, that I felt at once that if
      there was any vanity left in this memory of her past loveliness, it was
      sweet as the memory of their old fragrance left in the withered leaves of
      the roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it du not matter, du it, sir? Beauty is only skin-deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Beauty is as deep as the heart at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well to be sure, my old husband du say I be as handsome in his eyes as
      ever I be. But I beg your pardon, sir, for talkin&rsquo; about myself. I believe
      it was the old church&mdash;she set us on to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old church didn&rsquo;t lead you into any harm then,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;The
      beauty that is in the heart will shine out of the face again some day&mdash;be
      sure of that. And after all, there is just the same kind of beauty in a
      good old face that there is in an old church. You can&rsquo;t say the church is
      so trim and neat as it was the day that the first blast of the organ
      filled it as with, a living soul. The carving is not quite so sharp, the
      timbers are not quite so clean. There is a good deal of mould and
      worm-eating and cobwebs about the old place. Yet both you and I think it
      more beautiful now than it was then. Well, I believe it is, as nearly as
      possible, the same with an old face. It has got stained, and
      weather-beaten, and worn; but if the organ of truth has been playing on
      inside the temple of the Lord, which St. Paul says our bodies are, there
      is in the old face, though both form and complexion are gone, just the
      beauty of the music inside. The wrinkles and the brownness can&rsquo;t spoil it.
      A light shines through it all&mdash;that of the indwelling spirit. I wish
      we all grew old like the old churches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, but I thought I saw in her face that she understood my
      mysticism. We had been walking very slowly, had passed through the quaint
      lych-gate, and now the old woman had got the key in the lock of the door,
      whose archway was figured and fashioned as I have described above, with a
      dozen mouldings or more, most of them &ldquo;carved so curiously.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE OLD CHURCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The awe that dwells in churches fell upon me as I crossed the threshold&mdash;an
      awe I never fail to feel&mdash;heightened in many cases, no doubt, by the
      sense of antiquity and of art, but an awe which I have felt all the same
      in crossing the threshold of an old Puritan conventicle, as the place
      where men worship and have worshipped the God of their fathers, although
      for art there was only the science of common bricklaying, and for beauty
      staring ugliness. To the involuntary fancy, the air of petition and of
      holy need seems to linger in the place, and the uncovered head
      acknowledges the sacred symbols of human inspiration and divine revealing.
      But this was no ordinary church into which I followed the gentlewoman who
      was my guide. As entering I turned my eyes eastward, a flush of subdued
      glory invaded them from the chancel, all the windows of which were of
      richly stained glass, and the roof of carved oak lavishly gilded. I had my
      thoughts about this chancel, and thence about chancels generally which may
      appear in another part of my story. Now I have to do only with the church,
      not with the cogitations to which it gave rise. But I will not trouble my
      reader with even what I could tell him of the blending and contradicting
      of styles and modes of architectural thought in the edifice. Age is to the
      work of contesting human hands a wonderful harmoniser of differences. As
      nature brings into harmony all fractures of her frame, and even positive
      intrusions upon her realm, clothes and discolours them, in the old sense
      of the word, so that at length there is no immediate shock at sight of
      that which in itself was crude, and is yet coarse, so the various
      architecture of this building had been gone over after the builders by the
      musical hand of Eld, with wonder of delicate transition and change of key,
      that one could almost fancy the music of its exquisite organ had been at
      work <i>informing</i> the building, half melting the sutures, wearing the
      sharpness, and blending the angles, until in some parts there was but the
      gentle flickering of the original conception left, all its self-assertion
      vanished under the file of the air and the gnawing of the worm. True, the
      hand of the restorer had been busy, but it had wrought lovingly and
      gently, and wherein it had erred, the same influences of nature, though as
      yet their effects were invisible, were already at work&mdash;of the many
      making one. I will not trouble my reader, I say, with any architectural
      description, which, possibly even more than a detailed description of
      natural beauty dissociated from human feeling, would only weary him, even
      if it were not unintelligible. When we are reading a poem, we do not first
      of all examine the construction and dwell on the rhymes and rhythms; all
      that comes after, if we find that the poem itself is so good that its
      parts are therefore worth examining, as being probably good in themselves,
      and elucidatory of the main work. There were carvings on the ends of the
      benches all along the aisle on both sides, well worth examination, and
      some of them even of description; but I shall not linger on these. A word
      only about the columns: they supported arches of different fashion on the
      opposite sides, but they were themselves similar in matter and
      construction, both remarkable. They were of coarse granite of the country,
      chiselled, but very far from smooth, not to say polished. Each pillar was
      a single stone with chamfered sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking softly through the ancient house, forgetting in the many thoughts
      that arose within me that I had a companion, I came at length into the
      tower, the basement of which was open, forming part of the body of the
      church. There hung many ropes through holes in a ceiling above, for
      bell-ringing was encouraged and indeed practised by my friend Shepherd.
      And as I regarded them, I thought within myself how delightful it would be
      if in these days as in those of Samuel, the word of God was precious; so
      that when it came to the minister of his people&mdash;a fresh vision of
      his glory, a discovery of his meaning&mdash;he might make haste to the
      church, and into the tower, lay hold of the rope that hung from the
      deepest-toned bell of all, and constrain it by the force of strong arms to
      utter its voice of call, &ldquo;Come hither, come hear, my people, for God hath
      spoken;&rdquo; and from the streets or the lanes would troop the eager folk; the
      plough be left in the furrow, the cream in the churn; and the crowding
      people bring faces into the church, all with one question upon them&mdash;&ldquo;What
      hath the Lord spoken?&rdquo; But now it would be answer sufficient to such a
      call to say, &ldquo;But what will become of the butter?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;An hour&rsquo;s
      ploughing will be lost.&rdquo; And the clergy&mdash;how would they bring about
      such a time? They do not even believe that God has a word to his people
      through them. They think that his word is petrified for use in the Bible
      and Prayer-book; that the wise men of old heard so much of the word of
      God, and have so set it down, that there is no need for any more words of
      the Lord coming to the prophets of a land; therefore they look down upon
      the prophesying&mdash;that is, the preaching of the word&mdash;make light
      of it, the best of them, say these prayers are everything, or all but
      everything: <i>their</i> hearts are not set upon hearing what God the Lord
      will speak that they may speak it abroad to his people again. Therefore it
      is no wonder if the church bells are obedient only to the clock, are no
      longer subject to the spirit of the minister, and have nothing to do in
      telegraphing between heaven and earth. They make little of this part of
      their duty; and no wonder, if what is to be spoken must remain such as
      they speak. They put the Church for God, and the prayers which are the
      word of man to God, for the word of God to man. But when the prophets see
      no vision, how should they have any word to speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts were passing through my mind when my eye fell upon my
      guide. She was seated against the south wall of the tower, on a stool, I
      thought, or small table. While I was wandering about the church she had
      taken her stocking and wires out of her pocket, and was now knitting
      busily. How her needles did go! Her eyes never regarded them, however,
      but, fixed on the slabs that paved the tower at a yard or two from her
      feet, seemed to be gazing far out to sea, for they had an infinite
      objectless outlook. To try her, I took for the moment the position of an
      accuser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t mind working in church?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I spoke she instantly rose, her eyes turned as from the far sea-waves
      to my face, and light came out of them. With a smile she answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church knows me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has that to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she minds it. We are told to be diligent in business, you
      know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it does not say in church and out of church. You could be
      diligent somewhere else, couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as I said this, I began to fear she would think I meant it. But
      she only smiled and said, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt she, sir; and my good man, who
      does all he can to keep her tidy, is out at toes and heels, and if I don&rsquo;t
      keep he warm he&rsquo;ll be laid up, and then the church won&rsquo;t be kep&rsquo; nice,
      sir, till he&rsquo;s up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was tempted to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could have sat down outside&mdash;there are some nice gravestones
      near&mdash;and waited till I came out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the church for, sir? The sun&rsquo;s werry hot to-day, sir; and Mr.
      Shepherd, he say, sir, that the church is like the shadow of a great rock
      in a weary land. So, you see, if I was to sit out in the sun, instead of
      comin&rsquo; in here to the cool o&rsquo; the shadow, I wouldn&rsquo;t be takin&rsquo; the church
      at her word. It does my heart good to sit in the old church, sir. There&rsquo;s
      a something do seem to come out o&rsquo; the old walls and settle down like the
      cool o&rsquo; the day upon my old heart that&rsquo;s nearly tired o&rsquo; crying, and would
      fain keep its eyes dry for the rest o&rsquo; the journey. My old man&rsquo;s stockin&rsquo; 
      won&rsquo;t hurt the church, sir, and, bein&rsquo; a good deed as I suppose it is,
      it&rsquo;s none the worse for the place. I think, if He was to come by wi&rsquo; the
      whip o&rsquo; small cords, I wouldn&rsquo;t be afeared of his layin&rsquo; it upo&rsquo; my old
      back. Do you think he would, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus driven to speak as I thought, I made haste to reply, more delighted
      with the result of my experiment than I cared to let her know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do not. I was only talking. It is but selfish, cheating, or
      ill-done work that the church&rsquo;s Master drives away. All our work ought to
      be done in the shadow of the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you be only having a talk about it, sir,&rdquo; she said, smiling her
      sweet old smile. &ldquo;Nobody knows what this old church is to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the old woman had a good husband, apparently: the sorrows which had
      left their mark even upon her smile, must have come from her family, I
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a family?&rdquo; I said, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had thirteen,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Six bys and seven maidens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are rich!&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;And where are they all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four maidens be lying in the churchyard, sir; two be married, and one be
      down in the mill, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them be lyin&rsquo; beside his sisters&mdash;drownded afore my eyes,
      sir. Three o&rsquo; them be at sea, and two o&rsquo; them in it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At sea! I thought. What a wide <i>where</i>! As vague to the imagination,
      almost, as <i>in the other world</i>. How a mother&rsquo;s thoughts must go
      roaming about the waste, like birds that have lost their nest, to find
      them!
    </p>
    <p>
      As this thought kept me silent for a few moments, she resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It be no wonder, be it, sir? that I like to creep into the church with my
      knitting. Many&rsquo;s the stormy night, when my husband couldn&rsquo;t keep still,
      but would be out on the cliffs or on the breakwater, for no good in life,
      but just to hear the roar of the waves that he could only see by the white
      of them, with the balls o&rsquo; foam flying in his face in the dark&mdash;many&rsquo;s
      the such a night that I have left the house after he was gone, with this
      blessed key in my hand, and crept into the old church here, and sat down
      where I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; now&mdash;leastways where I was sittin&rsquo; when your
      reverence spoke to me&mdash;and hearkened to the wind howling about the
      place. The church windows never rattle, sir&mdash;like the cottage
      windows, as I suppose you know, sir. Somehow, I feel safe in the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you had sons at sea,&rdquo; said I, again wishing to draw her out, &ldquo;it
      would not be of much good to you to feel safe yourself, so long as they
      were in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! yes, it be, sir. What&rsquo;s the good of feeling safe yourself but it let
      you know other people be safe too? It&rsquo;s when you don&rsquo;t feel safe yourself
      that you feel other people ben&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said&mdash;and such confidence I had from what she had already
      uttered, that I was sure the experiment was not a cruel one&mdash;&ldquo;some of
      your sons <i>were</i> drowned for all that you say about their safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she answered, with a sigh, &ldquo;I trust they&rsquo;re none the less
      safe for that. It would be a strange thing for an old woman like me,
      well-nigh threescore and ten, to suppose that safety lay in not being
      drownded. Why, they might ha&rsquo; been cast on a desert island, and wasted to
      skin an&rsquo; bone, and got home again wi&rsquo; the loss of half the wits they set
      out with. Wouldn&rsquo;t that ha&rsquo; been worse than being drownded right off? And
      that wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; been the worst, either. The church she seem to tell me
      all the time, that for all the roaring outside, there be really no danger
      after all. What matter if they go to the bottom? What is the bottom of the
      sea, sir? You bein&rsquo; a clergyman can tell that, sir. I shouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; known
      it if I hadn&rsquo;t had bys o&rsquo; my own at sea, sir. But you can tell, sir,
      though you ain&rsquo;t got none there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And though she was putting her parson to his catechism, the smile that
      returned on her face was as modest as if she had only been listening to
      his instruction. I had not long to look for my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hollow of his hand,&rdquo; I said, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would know it, sir,&rdquo; she returned, with a little glow of
      triumph in her tone. &ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s just what the church tells me
      when I come in here in the stormy nights. I bring my knitting then too,
      sir, for I can knit in the dark as well as in the light almost; and when
      they come home, if they do come home, they&rsquo;re none the worse that I went
      to the old church to pray for them. There it goes roaring about them poor
      dears, all out there; and their old mother sitting still as a stone almost
      in the quiet old church, a caring for them. And then it do come across me,
      sir, that God be a sitting in his own house at home, hearing all the noise
      and all the roaring in which his children are tossed about in the world,
      watching it all, letting it drown some o&rsquo; them and take them back to him,
      and keeping it from going too far with others of them that are not quite
      ready for that same. I have my thoughts, you see, sir, though I be an old
      woman; and not nice to look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had come upon a genius. How nature laughs at our schools sometimes!
      Education, so-called, is a fine thing, and might be a better thing; but
      there is an education, that of life, which, when seconded by a pure will
      to learn, leaves the schools behind, even as the horse of the desert would
      leave behind the slow pomposity of the common-fed goose. For life is God&rsquo;s
      school, and they that will listen to the Master there will learn at God&rsquo;s
      speed. For one moment, I am ashamed to say, I was envious of Shepherd, and
      repined that, now old Rogers was gone, I had no such glorious old
      stained-glass window in my church to let in the eternal upon my
      light-thirsty soul. I must say for myself that the feeling lasted but for
      a moment, and that no sooner had the shadow of it passed and the true
      light shined after it, than I was heartily ashamed of it. Why should not
      Shepherd have the old woman as well as I? True, Shepherd was more of what
      would now be called a ritualist than I; true, I thought my doctrine
      simpler and therefore better than his; but was this any reason why I
      should have all the grand people to minister to in my parish! Recovering
      myself, I found her last words still in my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very nice to look at,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You must not find fault with the
      work of God, because you would like better to be young and pretty than to
      be as you now are. Time and time&rsquo;s rents and furrows are all his making
      and his doing. God makes nothing ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure of that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused. Such a question from such a woman &ldquo;must give us pause.&rdquo; And, as
      I paused, the thought of certain animals flashed into my mind and I could
      not insist that God had never made anything ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am not sure of it,&rdquo; I answered. For of all things my soul recoiled
      from, any professional pretence of knowing more than I did know seemed to
      me the most repugnant to the spirit and mind of the Master, whose servants
      we are, or but the servants of mere priestly delusion and self-seeking.
      &ldquo;But if he does,&rdquo; I went on to say, &ldquo;it must be that we may see what it is
      like, and therefore not like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, unwilling all at once to plunge with her into such an abyss as the
      question opened, I turned the conversation to an object on which my eyes
      had been for some time resting half-unconsciously. It was the sort of
      stool or bench on which my guide had been sitting. I now thought it was
      some kind of box or chest. It was curiously carved in old oak, very much
      like the ends of the benches and book-boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that you were sitting on?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;A chest or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It be there when we come to this place, and that be nigh fifty years
      agone, sir. But what it be, you&rsquo;ll be better able to tell than I be, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps a chest for holding the communion-plate in old time,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;But how should it then come to be banished to the tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it can&rsquo;t be that. It be some sort of ancient musical piano, I be
      thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stooped and saw that its lid was shaped like the cover of an organ. With
      some difficulty I opened it; and there, to be sure, was a row of huge
      keys, fit for the fingers of a Cyclops. I pressed upon them, one after
      another, but no sound followed. They were stiff to the touch; and once
      down, so they mostly remained until lifted again. I looked if there was
      any sign of a bellows, thinking it must have been some primitive kind of
      reed-instrument, like what we call a seraphine or harmonium now-a-days.
      But there was no hole through which there could have been any
      communication with or from a bellows, although there might have been a
      small one inside. There were, however, a dozen little round holes in the
      fixed part of the top, which might afford some clue to the mystery of its
      former life. I could not find any way of reaching the inside of it, so
      strongly was it put together; therefore I was left, I thought, to the
      efforts of my imagination alone for any hope of discovery with regard to
      the instrument, seeing further observation was impossible. But here I
      found that I was mistaken in two important conclusions, the latter of
      which depended on the former. The first of these was that it was an
      instrument: it was only one end of an instrument; therefore, secondly,
      there might be room for observation still. But I found this out by
      accident, which has had a share in most discoveries, and which, meaning a
      something that falls into our hands unlocked for, is so far an
      unobjectionable word even to the man who does not believe in chance. I had
      for the time given up the question as insoluble, and was gazing about the
      place, when, glancing up at the holes in the ceiling through which the
      bell-ropes went, I spied two or three thick wires hanging through the same
      ceiling close to the wall, and right over the box with the keys. The vague
      suspicion of a discovery dawned upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the key of the tower?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. But I&rsquo;ll run home for it at once,&rdquo; she answered. And rising, she
      went out in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; thought I, looking after her. &ldquo;It is a word of the will and the
      feeling, not of the body.&rdquo; But I was mistaken. The dear old creature had
      no sooner got outside of the church-yard, within which, I presume, she
      felt that she must be decorous, than she did run, and ran well too. I was
      on the point of starting after her at full speed, to prevent her from
      hurting herself, but reflecting that her own judgment ought to be as good
      as mine in such a case, I returned, and sitting down on her seat, awaited
      her reappearance, gazing at the ceiling. There I either saw or imagined I
      saw signs of openings corresponding in number and position with those in
      the lid under me. In about three minutes the old woman returned, panting
      but not distressed, with a great crooked old key in her hand. Why are all
      the keys of a church so crooked? I did not ask her that question, though.
      What I said to her, was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t run like that. I am in no hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be you not, sir? I thought, by the way you spoke, you be taken with a
      longing to get a-top o&rsquo; the tower, and see all about you like. For you
      see, sir, fond as I be of the old church, I du feel sometimes as if she&rsquo;d
      smother me; and then nothing will do but I must get at the top of the old
      tower. And then, what with the sun, if there be any sun, and what with the
      fresh air which there always be up there, sir,&mdash;it du always be fresh
      up there, sir,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;I come back down again blessing the old
      church for its tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she was toiling up the winding staircase after me, where
      there was just room enough for my shoulders to get through by turning
      themselves a little across the lie of the steps. They were very high, but
      she kept up with me bravely, bearing out her statement that she was no
      stranger to them. As I ascended, however, I was not thinking of her, but
      of what she had said. Strange to tell, the significance of the towers or
      spires of our churches had never been clear to me before. True, I was
      quite awake to their significance, at least to that of the spires, as
      fingers pointing ever upwards to
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;regions mild of calm and serene air,
  Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot,
  Which men call Earth;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      but I had not thought of their symbolism as lifting one up above the
      church itself into a region where no church is wanted because the Lord God
      almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy church indeed, if it destroys the need of itself by lifting men up
      into the eternal kingdom! Would that I and all her servants lived pervaded
      with the sense of this her high end, her one high calling! We need the
      church towers to remind us that the mephitic airs in the church below are
      from the churchyard at its feet, which so many take for the church,
      worshipping over the graves and believing in death&mdash;or at least in
      the material substance over which alone death hath power. Thus the church,
      even in her corruption, lifts us out of her corruption, sending us up her
      towers and her spires to admonish us that she too lives in the air of
      truth: that her form too must pass away, while the truth that is embodied
      in her lives beyond forms and customs and prejudices, shining as the stars
      for ever and ever. He whom the church does not lift up above the church is
      not worthy to be a doorkeeper therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such thoughts passed through me, satisfied me, and left me peaceful, so
      that before I had reached the top, I was thanking the Lord&mdash;not for
      his church-tower, but for his sexton&rsquo;s wife. The old woman was a jewel. If
      her husband was like her, which was too much to expect&mdash;if he
      believed in her, it would be enough, quite&mdash;then indeed the little
      child, who answered on being questioned thereanent, as the Scotch would
      say, that the three orders of ministers in the church were the parson,
      clerk, and sexton, might not be so far wrong in respect of this individual
      case. So in the ascent, and the thinking associated therewith, I forgot
      all about the special object for which I had requested the key of the
      tower, and led the way myself up to the summit, where stepping out of a
      little door, which being turned only heavenwards had no pretence for, or
      claim upon a curiously crooked key, but opened to the hand laid upon the
      latch, I thought of the words of the judicious Hooker, that &ldquo;the
      assembling of the church to learn&rdquo; was &ldquo;the receiving of angels descended
      from above;&rdquo; and in such a whimsical turn as our thoughts will often take
      when we are not heeding them, I wondered for a moment whether that was why
      the upper door was left on the latch, forgetting that that could not be of
      much use, if the door in the basement was kept locked with the crooked
      key. But the whole suggested something true about my own heart and that of
      my fellows, if not about the church: Revelation is not enough, the open
      trap-door is not enough, if the door of the heart is not open likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon, however, as I stepped out upon the roof of the tower, I forgot
      again all that had thus passed through my mind, swift as a dream. For,
      filling the west, lay the ocean beneath, with a dark curtain of storm
      hanging in perpendicular lines over part of its horizon, and on the other
      side was the peaceful solid land, with its numberless shades of green, its
      heights and hollows, its farms and wooded vales&mdash;there was not much
      wood&mdash;its scattered villages and country dwellings, lighted and
      shadowed by the sun and the clouds. Beyond lay the blue heights of
      Dartmoor. And over all, bathing us as it passed, moved the wind, the
      life-bearing spirit of the whole, the servant of the sun. The old woman
      stood beside me, silently enjoying my enjoyment, with a still smile that
      seemed to say in kindly triumph, &ldquo;Was I not right about the tower and the
      wind that dwells among its pinnacles?&rdquo; I drank deep of the universal
      flood, the outspread peace, the glory of the sun, and the haunting shadow
      of the sea that lay beyond like the visual image of the eternal silence&mdash;as
      it looks to us&mdash;that rounds our little earthly life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a good many trees in the church-yard, and as I looked down, the
      tops of them in their richest foliage hid all the graves directly below
      me, except a single flat stone looking up through an opening in the
      leaves, which seemed to have been just made for it to let it see the top
      of the tower. Upon the stone a child was seated playing with a few flowers
      she had gathered, not once looking up to the gilded vanes that rose from
      the four pinnacles at the corners of the tower. I turned to the eastern
      side, and looked over upon the church roof. It lay far below&mdash;looking
      very narrow and small, but long, with the four ridges of four steep roofs
      stretching away to the eastern end. It was in excellent repair, for the
      parish was almost all in one lord&rsquo;s possession, and he was proud of his
      church: between them he and Mr. Shepherd had made it beautiful to behold
      and strong to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I turned to look again, the little child was gone. Some butterfly
      fancy had seized her, and she was away. A little lamb was in her place,
      nibbling at the grass that grew on the side of the next mound. And when I
      looked seaward there was a sloop, like a white-winged sea-bird, rounding
      the end of a high projecting rock from the south, to bear up the little
      channel that led to the gates of the harbour canal. Out of the circling
      waters it had flown home, not from a long voyage, but hardly the less
      welcome therefore to those that waited and looked for her signal from the
      barrier rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reentering by the angels&rsquo; door to descend the narrow cork-screw stair, so
      dark and cool, I caught a glimpse, one turn down, by the feeble light that
      came through its chinks after it was shut behind us, of a tiny maiden-hair
      fern growing out of the wall. I stopped, and said to the old woman&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a sick daughter at home, or I wouldn&rsquo;t rob your tower of this
      lovely little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what eyes you have! I never saw the thing before. Do take it
      home to miss. It&rsquo;ll do her good to see it. I be main sorry to hear you&rsquo;ve
      got a sick maiden. She ben&rsquo;t a bedlar, be she, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was busy with my knife getting out all the roots I could without hurting
      them, and before I had succeeded I had remembered Turner&rsquo;s using the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but she can&rsquo;t even sit up, and must be
      carried everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear! Everyone has their troubles, sir. The sea&rsquo;s been mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued talking and asking kind questions about Connie as we went
      down the stair. Not till she opened a little door I had passed without
      observing it as we came up, was I reminded of my first object in ascending
      the tower. For this door revealed a number of bells hanging in silent
      power in the brown twilight of the place. I entered carefully, for there
      were only some planks laid upon the joists to keep one&rsquo;s feet from going
      through the ceiling. In a few moments I had satisfied myself that my
      conjecture about the keys below was correct. The small iron rods I had
      seen from beneath hung down from this place. There were more of them
      hanging shorter above, and there was yet enough of a further mechanism
      remaining to prove that those keys, by means of the looped and cranked
      rods, had been in connection with hammers, one of them indeed remaining
      also, which struck the bells, so that a tune could be played upon them as
      upon any other keyed instrument. This was the first contrivance of the
      kind I had ever seen, though I have heard of it in other churches since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could find a clever blacksmith in the neighbourhood, now,&rdquo; I said to
      myself, &ldquo;I would get this all repaired, so that it should not interfere
      with the bell-ringing when the ringers were to be had, and yet Shepherd
      could play a psalm tune to his parish at large when he pleased.&rdquo; For
      Shepherd was a very fair musician, and gave a good deal of time to the
      organ. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand notion, to think of him sitting here in the gloom,
      with that great musical instrument towering above him, whence he sends
      forth the voice of gladness, almost of song to his people, while they are
      mowing the grass, binding the sheaves, or gazing abroad over the stormy
      ocean in doubt, anxiety, and fear. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the parson at his bells,&rsquo; they
      would say, and stop and listen; and some phrase might sink into their
      hearts, waking some memory, or giving birth to some hope or faint
      aspiration. I will see what can be done.&rdquo; Having come to this conclusion,
      I left the abode of the bells, descended to the church, bade my
      conductress good morning, saying I would visit her soon in her own house,
      and bore home to my child the spoil which, without kirk-rapine, I had torn
      from the wall of the sanctuary. By this time the stormy veil had lifted
      from the horizon, and the sun was shining in full power without one
      darkening cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere I left the churchyard I would have a glance at the stone which ever
      seemed to lie gazing up at the tower. I soon found it, because it was the
      only one in that quarter from which I could see the top of the tower. It
      recorded the life and death of an aged pair who had been married fifty
      years, concluding with the couplet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time this may seem to be, But it did not seem long to we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole story of a human life lay in that last verse. True, it was not
      good grammar; but they had got through fifty years of wedded life probably
      without any knowledge of grammar to harmonise or to shorten them, and I
      daresay, had they been acquainted with the lesson he had put into their
      dumb mouths, they would have been aware of no ground of quarrel with the
      poetic stone-cutter, who most likely had thrown the verses in when he made
      his claim for the stone and the cutting. Having learnt this one by heart,
      I went about looking for anything more in the shape of sepulchral flora
      that might interest or amuse my crippled darling; nor had I searched long
      before I found one, the sole but triumphant recommendation of which was
      the thorough &ldquo;puzzle-headedness&rdquo; of its construction. I quite reckoned on
      seeing Connie trying to make it out, looking as bewildered over its
      excellent grammar, as the poet of the other ought to have looked over his
      rhymes, ere he gave in to the use of the nominative after a preposition.

      As I walked home, the rush of the rising tide was in my ears. To my fancy,
      the ocean, awaking from a swoon in which its life had ebbed to its heart,
      was sending that life abroad to its extremities, and waves breaking in
      white were the beats of its reviving pulse, the flashes of returning
      light. But so gentle was its motion, and so lovely its hue, that I could
      not help contrasting it with its reflex in the mind of her who took refuge
      from the tumult of its noises in the hollow of the old church. To her, let
      it look as blue as the sky, as peaceful and as moveless, it was a wild,
      reckless, false, devouring creature, a prey to its own moods, and to that
      of the blind winds which, careless of consequences, urged it to raving
      fury. Only, while the sea took this form to her imagination, she believed
      in that which held the sea, and knew that, when it pleased God to part his
      confining fingers, there would be no more sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached home, I went straight to Connie&rsquo;s room. Now the house was
      one of a class to every individual of which, whatever be its style or
      shape, I instantly become attached almost as if it possessed a measure of
      the life which it has sheltered. This class of human dwellings consists of
      the houses that have <i>grown</i>. They have not been, built after a
      straight-up-and-down model of uninteresting convenience or money-loving
      pinchedness. They must have had some plan, good, bad, or indifferent, as
      the case may be, at first, I suppose; but that plan they have left far
      behind, having grown with the necessities or ambitions of succeeding
      possessors, until the fact that they have a history is as plainly written
      on their aspect as on that of any you or daughter of Adam. These are the
      houses which the fairies used to haunt, and if there is any truth in
      ghost-stories, the houses which ghosts will yet haunt; and hence perhaps
      the sense of soothing comfort which pervades us when we cross their
      thresholds. You do not know, the moment you have cast a glance about the
      hall, where the dining-room, drawing-room, and best bedroom are. You have
      got it all to find out, just as the character of a man; and thus had I to
      find out this house of my friend Shepherd. It had formerly been a kind of
      manor-house, though altogether unlike any other manor-house I ever saw;
      for after exercising all my constructive ingenuity reversed in pulling it
      to pieces in my mind, I came to the conclusion that the germ-cell of it
      was a cottage of the simplest sort which had grown by the addition of
      other cells, till it had reached the development in which we found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that the dining-room was almost on the level of the shore.
      Certainly some of the flat stones that coped the low wall in front of it
      were thrown into the garden before the next winter by the waves. But
      Connie&rsquo;s room looked out on a little flower-garden almost on the downs,
      only sheltered a little by the rise of a short grassy slope above it.
      This, however, left the prospect, from her window down the bay and out to
      sea, almost open. To reach this room I had now to go up but one simple
      cottage stair; for the door of the house entered on the first floor, that
      is, as regards the building, midway between heaven and earth. It had a
      large bay-window; and in this window Connie was lying on her couch, with
      the lower sash wide open, through which the breeze entered, smelling of
      sea-weed tempered with sweet grasses and the wall-flowers and stocks that
      were in the little plot under it. I thought I could see an improvement in
      her already. Certainly she looked very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it delightful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, everything. The wind, and the sky, and the sea, and the smell of the
      flowers. Do look at that sea-bird. His wings are like the barb of a
      terrible arrow. How he goes undulating, neck and body, up and down as he
      flies. I never felt before that a bird moves his wings. It always looked
      as if the wings flew with the bird. But I see the effort in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An easy effort, though, I should certainly think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. But I see that he chooses and means to fly, and so does it. It
      makes one almost reconciled to the idea of wings. Do angels really have
      wings, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is generally so represented, I think, in the Bible. But whether it is
      meant as a natural fact about them, is more than I take upon me to decide.
      For one thing, I should have to examine whether in simple narrative they
      are ever represented with them, as, I think, in records of visions they
      are never represented without them. But wings are very beautiful things,
      and I do not exactly see why you should need reconciling to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie gave a little shrug of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the notion of them growing out at my shoulder-blades. And
      however would you get on your clothes? If you put them over your wings,
      they would be of no use, and would, besides, make you hump-backed; and if
      you did not, everything would have to be buttoned round the roots of them.
      You could not do it yourself, and even on Wynnie I don&rsquo;t think I could
      bear to touch the things&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean the feathers, but the skinny,
      folding-up bits of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at her fastidious fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to fly, I suppose?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes; I should like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t want to have wings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind the wings exactly; but however would one be able
      to keep them nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go; starting from one thing to another, like a real bird
      already. When you can&rsquo;t answer one thing, off to another, and, from your
      new perch on the hawthorn, talk as if you were still on the topmost branch
      of the lilac!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, papa! That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard you say to mamma twenty times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did I ever say to your mamma anything but the truth? or to you
      either, you puss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not yet discovered that when I used this epithet to my Connie, she
      always thought she had gone too far. She looked troubled. I hastened to
      relieve her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When women have wings,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;their logic will be good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you make that out, papa?&rdquo; she asked, a little re-assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because then every shadow of feeling that turns your speech aside from
      the straight course will be recognised in that speech; the whole utterance
      will be instinct not only with the meaning of what you are thinking, but
      with the reflex of the forces in you that make the utterance take this or
      that shape; just as to a perfect palate, the source and course of a stream
      would be revealed in every draught of its water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just a glimmering of your meaning, papa. Would you like to have
      wings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to fly like a bird, to swim like a fish, to gallop like a
      horse, to creep like a serpent, but I suspect the good of all these is to
      be got without doing any of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean now, but I can&rsquo;t put it in words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean by a perfect sympathy with the creatures that do these things:
      what it may please God to give to ourselves, we can quite comfortably
      leave to him. A higher stratum of the same kind is the need we feel of
      knowing our fellow-creatures through and through, of walking into and out
      of their worlds as if we were, because we are, perfectly at home in them.&mdash;But
      I am talking what the people who do not understand such things lump all
      together as mysticism, which is their name for a kind of spiritual
      ash-pit, whither they consign dust and stones, never asking whether they
      may not be gold-dust and rubies, all in a heap.&mdash;You had better begin
      to think about getting out, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think about it, papa! I have been thinking about it ever since daylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go and see what your mother is doing then, and if she is ready to
      go out with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments all was arranged. Without killing more than a snail or
      two, which we could not take time to beware of, Walter and I&mdash;finding
      that the window did not open down to the ground in French fashion, for
      which there were two good reasons, one the fierceness of the winds in
      winter, the other, the fact that the means of egress were elsewise
      provided&mdash;lifted the sofa, Connie and all, out over the window-sill,
      and then there was only a little door in the garden-wall to get her
      through before we found ourselves upon the down. I think the ascent of
      this hill was the first experience I had&mdash;a little to my humiliation,
      nothing to my sorrow&mdash;that I was descending another hill. I had to
      set down the precious burden rather oftener before we reached the brow of
      the cliffs than would have been necessary ten years before. But this was
      all right, and the newly-discovered weakness then was strength to the
      power which carries me about on my two legs now. It is all right still. I
      shall be stronger by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      We carried her high enough for her to see the brilliant waters lying many
      feet below her, with the sea-birds of which we had talked winging their
      undulating way between heaven and ocean. It is when first you have a
      chance of looking a bird in the face on the wing that you know what the
      marvel of flight is. There it hangs or rests, which you please, borne up,
      as far as eye or any of the senses can witness, by its own will alone.
      This Connie, quicker than I in her observation of nature, had already
      observed. Seated on the warm grass by her side, while neither talked, but
      both regarded the blue spaces, I saw one of those same barb-winged birds
      rest over my head, regarding me from above, as if doubtful whether I did
      not afford some claim to his theory of treasure-trove. I knew at once that
      what Connie had been saying to me just before was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay silent a long time. I too was silent. At length I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you longing to be running about amongst the rocks, my Connie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa; not a bit. I don&rsquo;t know how it is, but I don&rsquo;t think I ever
      wished much for anything I knew I could not have. I am enjoying everything
      more than I can tell you. I wish Wynnie were as happy as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Do you think she&rsquo;s not happy, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t want any thinking, papa. You can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you&rsquo;re right, Connie. What do you think is the cause of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is because she can&rsquo;t wait. She&rsquo;s always going out to meet
      things; and then when they&rsquo;re not there waiting for her, she thinks
      they&rsquo;re nowhere. But I always think her way is finer than mine. If
      everybody were like me, there wouldn&rsquo;t be much done in the world, would
      there, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events, my dear, your way is wise for you, and I am glad you do
      not judge your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Wynnie, papa! That would be cool impudence. She&rsquo;s worth ten of me.
      Don&rsquo;t you think, papa,&rdquo; she added, after a pause, &ldquo;that if Mary had said
      the smallest word against Martha, as Martha did against Mary, Jesus would
      have had a word to say on Martha&rsquo;s side next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do, my dear. And I think that did not sit very long without
      asking Jesus if she mightn&rsquo;t go and help her sister. There is but one
      thing needful&mdash;that is, the will of God; and when people love that
      above everything, they soon come to see that to everything else there are
      two sides, and that only the will of God gives fair play, as we call it,
      to both of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another silence followed. Then Connie spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not strange, papa, that the only thine here that makes me want to
      get up to look, is nothing of all the grand things round about me? I am
      just lying like the convex mirror in the school-room at home, letting them
      all paint themselves in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it then that makes you wish to get up and go and see?&rdquo; I asked
      with real curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see down there&mdash;away across the bay&mdash;amongst the rocks
      at the other side, a man sitting sketching?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked for some time before I could discover him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sight is good, Connie: I see the man, but I could not tell what he
      was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see him lifting his head every now and then for a moment, and
      then keeping it down for a longer while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot distinguish that. But then I am shortsighted rather, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how you see so many little things that nobody else seems to
      notice, then, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because I have trained myself to observe. The degree of power in
      the sight is of less consequence than the habit of seeing. But you have
      not yet told me what it is that makes you desirous of getting up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to look over his shoulder, and see what he is doing. Is it not
      strange that in the midst of all this plenty of beautifulness, I should
      want to rise to look at a few lines and scratches, or smears of colour,
      upon a bit of paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear; I don&rsquo;t think it is strange. There a new element of interest
      is introduced&mdash;the human. No doubt there is deep humanity in all this
      around us. No doubt all the world, in all its moods, is human, as those
      for whose abode and instruction it was made. No doubt, it would be void of
      both beauty and significance to our eyes, were it not that it is one crowd
      of pictures of the human mind, blended in one living fluctuating whole.
      But these meanings are there in solution as it were. The individual is a
      centre of crystallisation to this solution. Around him meanings gather,
      are separated from other meanings; and if he be an artist, by which I mean
      true painter, true poet, or true musician, as the case may be he so
      isolates and represents them, that we see them&mdash;not what nature shows
      to us, but what nature has shown, to him, determined by his nature and
      choice. With it is mingled therefore so much of his own individuality,
      manifested both in this choice and certain modifications determined by his
      way of working, that you have not only a representation of an aspect of
      nature, as far as that may be with limited powers and materials, but a
      revelation of the man&rsquo;s own mind and nature. Consequently there is a human
      interest in every true attempt to reproduce nature, an interest of
      individuality which does not belong to nature herself, who is for all and
      every man. You have just been saying that you were lying there like a
      convex mirror reflecting all nature around you. Every man is such a convex
      mirror; and his drawing, if he can make one, is an attempt to show what is
      in this little mirror of his, kindled there by the grand world outside.
      And the human mirrors being all differently formed, vary infinitely in
      what they would thus represent of the same scene. I have been greatly
      interested in looking alternately over the shoulders of two artists, both
      sketching in colour the same, absolutely the same scene, both trying to
      represent it with all the truth in their power. How different,
      notwithstanding, the two representations came out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand you, papa. But look a little farther off. Don&rsquo;t you
      see over the top of another rock a lady&rsquo;s bonnet. I do believe that&rsquo;s
      Wynnie. I know she took her box of water-colours out with her this
      morning, just before you came home. Dora went with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell by her ribbons, Connie? You seem sharp-sighted enough to
      see her face if she would show it. I don&rsquo;t even see the bonnet. If I were
      like some people I know, I should feel justified in denying its presence,
      attributing the whole to your fancy, and refusing anything to superiority
      of vision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be like you, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not; for I have no fancy for being shut up in my own blindness,
      when other people offer me their eyes to eke out the defects of my own
      with. But here comes mamma at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie&rsquo;s face brightened as if she had not seen her mother for a
      fortnight. My Ethelwyn always brought the home gladness that her name
      signified with her. She was a centre of radiating peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s Wynnie&rsquo;s bonnet over that black rock there,
      just beyond where you see that man drawing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You absurd child! How should I know Wynnie&rsquo;s bonnet at this distance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the little white feather you gave her out of your wardrobe
      just before we left? She put it in this morning before she went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do see something white. But I want you to look out there,
      towards what they call the Chapel Rock, at the other end of that long
      mound they call the breakwater. You will soon see a boat appear full of
      the coast-guard. I saw them going on board just as I left the house to
      come up to you. Their officer came down with his sword, and each of the
      men had a cutlass. I wonder what it can mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We looked. But before the boat made its appearance, Connie cried out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there! What a big boat that is rowing for the land, away northwards
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned my eyes in the direction she indicated, and saw a long boat with
      some half-dozen oars, full of men, rowing hard, apparently for some spot
      on the shore at a considerable distance to the north of our bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that boat has something to do with the coast-guard and
      their cutlasses. You&rsquo;ll see that, as soon as they get out of the bay, they
      will row in the same direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was. Our boat appeared presently from under the concealment of the
      heights on which we were, and made at full speed after the other boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely they can&rsquo;t be smugglers,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I thought all that was over and
      done with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the course of another twenty minutes, during which we watched their
      progress, both boats had disappeared behind the headland to the northward.
      Then, thinking Connie had had nearly enough of the sea air for her first
      experience of its influences, I went and fetched Walter, and we carried
      her back as we had brought her. She had not been in the shadow of her own
      room for five minutes before she was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now nearly time for our early dinner. We always dined early when we
      could, that we might eat along with our children. We were both convinced
      that the only way to make them behave like ladies and gentlemen was to
      have them always with us at meals. We had seen very unpleasant results in
      the children of those who allowed them to dine with no other supervision
      than the nursery afforded: they were a constant anxiety and occasional
      horror to those whom they visited&mdash;snatching like monkeys, and
      devouring like jackals, as selfishly as if they were mere animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! we&rsquo;ve seen such a nice gentleman!&rdquo; said Dora, becoming lively under
      the influence of her soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you, Dora? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting on the rocks, taking a portrait of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say he was a nice gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had such beautiful boots!&rdquo; answered Dora, at which there was a great
      laugh about the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! we must run and tell Connie that,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;It will make her
      laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you tell Connie, then, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! what was it, Charlie? I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another laugh followed at Harry&rsquo;s expense now, and we were all very merry,
      when Dora, who sat opposite to the window, called out, clapping her hands&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Niceboots again! There&rsquo;s Niceboots again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same moment the head of a young man appeared over the wall that
      separated the garden from the little beach that lay by the entrance of the
      canal. I saw at once that he must be more than ordinarily tall to show his
      face, for he was not close to the wall. It was a dark countenance, with a
      long beard, which few at that time wore, though now it is getting not
      uncommon, even in my own profession&mdash;a noble, handsome face, a little
      sad, with downbent eyes, which, released from their more immediate duty
      towards nature, had now bent themselves upon the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s contemplating his boots,&rdquo; said Wynnie, with apparent
      maliciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad of you, Wynnie,&rdquo; I said, and the child blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything, papa. It was only following up Dora&rsquo;s wise
      discrimination,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine-looking fellow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and ought, with that face and
      head, to be able to paint good pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see what he has done,&rdquo; said Wynnie; &ldquo;for, by the way we
      were sitting, I should think we were attempting the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that then, Wynnie?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rock,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;that you could not see from where you were
      sitting. I saw you on the top of the cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connie said it was you, by your bonnet. She, too, was wishing she could
      look over the shoulder of the artist at work beside you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not beside me. There were yards and yards of solid rock between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Space, you see, in removing things from the beholder, seems always to
      bring them nearer to each other, and the most differing things are classed
      under one name by the man who knows nothing about them. But what sort of a
      rock was it you were trying to draw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A strange-looking, conical rock, that stands alone in front of one of the
      ridges that project from the shore into the water. Three sea-birds, with
      long white wings, were flying about it, and the little waves of the rising
      tide were beating themselves against it and breaking in white plashes. So
      the rock stood between the blue and white below and the blue and white
      above; for, though there were no clouds, the birds gave the touches of
      white to the upper sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dora,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you are old enough to understand me;
      but sometimes little people are long in understanding, just because the
      older people think they can&rsquo;t, and don&rsquo;t try them.&mdash;Do you see, Dora,
      why I want you to learn to draw? Look how Wynnie sees things. That is, in
      a great measure, because she draws things, and has, by that, learned to
      watch in order to find out. It is a great thing to have your eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora&rsquo;s eyes were large, and she opened them to their full width, as if she
      would take in the universe at their little doors. Whether that indicated
      that she did not in the least understand what I had been saying, or that
      she was in sympathy with it, I cannot tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us go up to Connie, and tell her about the rock and everything
      else you have seen since you went out. We are all her messengers sent out
      to discover things, and bring back news of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little talk with Connie, I retired to the study, which was on the
      same floor as her room completing, indeed, the whole of that part of the
      house, which, seen from without, looked like a separate building; for it
      had a roof of its own, and stood higher up the rock than the rest of the
      dwelling. Here I began to glance over the books. To have the run of
      another man&rsquo;s library, especially if it has all been gathered by himself,
      is like having a pass-key into the chambers of his thought. Only, one must
      be wary, when he opens them, what marks on the books he takes for those of
      the present owner. A mistake here would breed considerable confusion and
      falsehood in any judgment formed from the library. I found, however, one
      thing plain enough, that Shepherd had kept up that love for an older
      English literature, which had been one of the cords to draw us towards
      each other when we were students together. There had been one point on
      which we especially agreed&mdash;that a true knowledge of the present, in
      literature, as in everything else, could only be founded upon a knowledge
      of what had gone before; therefore, that any judgment, in regard to the
      literature of the present day, was of no value which was not guided and
      influenced by a real acquaintance with the best of what had gone before,
      being liable to be dazzled and misled by novelty of form and other
      qualities which, whatever might be the real worth of the substance, were,
      in themselves, purely ephemeral. I had taken down a last-century edition
      of the poems of the brothers Fletcher, and, having begun to read a lovely
      passage in &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s Victory and Triumph,&rdquo; had gone into what I can only
      call an intellectual rage, at the impudence of the editor, who had altered
      innumerable words and phrases to suit the degenerate taste of his own
      time,&mdash;when a knock came to the door, and Charlie entered, breathless
      with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the boat with the men with the swords in it, and another boat
      behind them, twice as big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hurried out upon the road, and there, close under our windows, were the
      two boats we had seen in the morning, landing their crews on the little
      beach. The second boat was full of weather-beaten men, in all kinds of
      attire, some in blue jerseys, some in red shirts, some in ragged coats.
      One man, who looked their superior, was dressed in blue from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked the officer of the coast-guard, a sedate,
      thoughtful-looking man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vessel foundered, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Sprung a leak on Sunday morning.
      She was laden with iron, and in a heavy ground swell it shifted and
      knocked a hole in her. The poor fellows are worn out with the pump and
      rowing, upon little or nothing to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were trooping past us by this time, looking rather dismal, though not
      by any means abject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with them now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be taken in by the people. We&rsquo;ll get up a little subscription for
      them, but they all belong to the society the sailors have for sending the
      shipwrecked to their homes, or where they want to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s something to help,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. They&rsquo;ll be very glad of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s anything wanted that I can do for them, you must let me
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir. But I don&rsquo;t think there will be any occasion to trouble you.
      You are our new clergyman, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that. Only for a little while, till my friend Mr. Shepherd is
      able to come back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to lose Mr. Shepherd, sir. He&rsquo;s what they call high in
      these parts, but he&rsquo;s a great favourite with all the poor people, because
      you see he understands them as if he was of the same flesh and blood with
      themselves&mdash;as, for that matter, I suppose we all are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we weren&rsquo;t there would be nothing to say at all. Will any of these men
      be at church to-morrow, do you suppose? I am afraid sailors are not much
      in the way of going to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid not. You see they are all anxious to get home. Most likely
      they&rsquo;ll be all travelling to-morrow. It&rsquo;s a pity. It would be a good
      chance for saying something to them that they might think of again. But I
      often think that, perhaps&mdash;it&rsquo;s only my own fancy, and I don&rsquo;t set it
      up for anything&mdash;that sailors won&rsquo;t be judged exactly like other
      people. They&rsquo;re so knocked about, you see, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Nobody will be judged like any other body. To his own
      Master, who knows all about him, every man stands or falls. Depend upon
      it, God likes fair play, to use a homely phrase, far better than any
      sailor of them all. But that&rsquo;s not exactly the question. It seems to me
      the question is this: shall we, who know what a blessed thing life is
      because we know what God is like, who can trust in him with all our hearts
      because he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the friend of sinners,
      shall we not try all we can to let them, too, know the blessedness of
      trusting in their Father in heaven? If we could only get them to say the
      Lord&rsquo;s prayer, <i>meaning</i> it, think what that would be! Look here!
      This can&rsquo;t be called bribery, for they are in want of it, and it will show
      them I am friendly. Here&rsquo;s another sovereign. Give them my compliments,
      and say that if any of them happen to be in Kilkhaven tomorrow, I shall be
      quite pleased to welcome them to church. Tell them I will give them of my
      best there if they will come. Make the invitation merrily, you know. No
      long faces and solemn speech. I will give them the solemn speech when they
      come to church. But even there I hope God will keep the long face far from
      me. That is fittest for fear and suffering. And the house of God is the
      casket that holds the antidote against all fear and most suffering. But I
      am preaching my sermon on Saturday instead of Sunday, and keeping you from
      your ministration to the poor fellows. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give them your message as near as I can,&rdquo; he said, and we shook
      hands and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first experience we had of the might and battle of the ocean.
      To our eyes it lay quiet as a baby asleep. On that Sunday morning there
      had been no commotion here. Yet now at last, on the Saturday morning, home
      come the conquered and spoiled of the sea. As if with a mock she takes all
      they have, and flings them on shore again, with her weeds, and her shells,
      and her sand. Before the winter was over we had learned&mdash;how much
      more of that awful power that surrounds the habitable earth! By slow
      degrees the sense of its might grew upon us, first by the vision of its
      many aspects and moods, and then by more awful things that followed; for
      there are few coasts upon which the sea rages so wildly as upon this, the
      whole force of the Atlantic breaking upon it. Even when there is no storm
      within perhaps hundreds of miles, when all is still as a church on the
      land, the storm that raves somewhere out upon the vast waste, will drive
      the waves in upon the shore with such fury that not even a lifeboat could
      make its way through their yawning hollows, and their fierce, shattered,
      and tumbling crests.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. MY FIRST SERMON IN THE SEABOARD PARISH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the hope that some of the shipwrecked mariners might be present in the
      church the next day, I proceeded to consider my morning&rsquo;s sermon for the
      occasion. There was no difficulty in taking care at the same time that it
      should be suitable to the congregation, whether those sailors were there
      or not. I turned over in my mind several subjects. I thought, for
      instance, of showing them how this ocean that lay watchful and ready all
      about our island, all about the earth, was but a visible type or symbol of
      two other oceans, one very still, the other very awful and fierce; in
      fact, that three oceans surrounded us: one of the known world; one of the
      unseen world, that is, of death; one of the spirit&mdash;the devouring
      ocean of evil&mdash;and might I not have added yet another, encompassing
      and silencing all the rest&mdash;that of truth! The visible ocean seemed
      to make war upon the land, and the dwellers thereon. Restrained by the
      will of God and by him made subject more and more to the advancing
      knowledge of those who were created to rule over it, it was yet like a
      half-tamed beast ever ready to break loose and devour its masters. Of
      course this would have been but one aspect or appearance of it&mdash;for
      it was in truth all service; but this was the aspect I knew it must bear
      to those, seafaring themselves or not, to whom I had to speak. Then I
      thought I might show, that its power, like that of all things that man is
      ready to fear, had one barrier over which no commotion, no might of
      driving wind, could carry it, beyond which its loudest waves were dumb&mdash;the
      barrier of death. Hitherto and no further could its power reach. It could
      kill the body. It could dash in pieces the last little cock-boat to which
      the man clung, but thus it swept the man beyond its own region into the
      second sea of stillness, which we call death, out upon which the thoughts
      of those that are left behind can follow him only in great longings, vague
      conjectures, and mighty faith. Then I thought I could show them how,
      raving in fear, or lying still in calm deceit, there lay about the life of
      man a far more fearful ocean than that which threatened his body; for this
      would cast, could it but get a hold of him, both body and soul into hell&mdash;the
      sea of evil, of vice, of sin, of wrong-doing&mdash;they might call it by
      what name they pleased. This made war against the very essence of life,
      against God who is the truth, against love, against fairness, against
      fatherhood, motherhood, sisterhood, brotherhood, manhood, womanhood,
      against tenderness and grace and beauty, gathering into one pulp of
      festering death all that is noble, lovely, worshipful in the human nature
      made so divine that the one fearless man, the Lord Jesus Christ, shared it
      with us. This, I thought I might make them understand, was the only
      terrible sea, the only hopeless ocean from whose awful shore we must
      shrink and flee, the end of every voyage upon whose bosom was the bottom
      of its filthy waters, beyond the reach of all that is thought or spoken in
      the light, beyond life itself, but for the hand that reaches down from the
      upper ocean of truth, the hand of the Redeemer of men. I thought, I say,
      for a while, that I could make this, not definite, but very real to them.
      But I did not feel quite confident about it. Might they not in the
      symbolism forget the thing symbolised? And would not the symbol itself be
      ready to fade quite from their memory, or to return only in the vaguest
      shadow? And with the thought I perceived a far more excellent way. For the
      power of the truth lies of course in its revelation to the mind, and while
      for this there are a thousand means, none are so mighty as its embodiment
      in human beings and human life. There it is itself alive and active. And
      amongst these, what embodiment comes near to that in him who was perfect
      man in virtue of being at the root of the secret of humanity, in virtue of
      being the eternal Son of God? We are his sons in time: he is his Son in
      eternity, of whose sea time is but the broken sparkle. Therefore, I would
      talk to them about&mdash;but I will treat my reader now as if he were not
      my reader, but one of my congregation on that bright Sunday, my first in
      the Seaboard Parish, with the sea outside the church, flashing in the
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood at the lectern, which was in front of the altar-screen, I
      could see little of my congregation, partly from my being on a level with
      them, partly from the necessity for keeping my eyes and thoughts upon that
      which I read. When, however, I rose from prayer in the pulpit; then I
      felt, as usual with me, that I was personally present for personal
      influence with my people, and then I saw, to my great pleasure, that one
      long bench nearly in the middle of the church was full of such sunburnt
      men as could not be mistaken for any but mariners, even if their torn and
      worn garments had not revealed that they must be the very men about whom
      we had been so much interested. Not only were they behaving with perfect
      decorum, but their rough faces wore an aspect of solemnity which I do not
      suppose was by any means their usual aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave them no text. I had one myself, which was the necessary thing. They
      should have it by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a man went up a mountain, and stayed there
      till it was dark, and stayed on. Now, a man who finds himself on a
      mountain as the sun is going down, especially if he is alone, makes haste
      to get down before it is dark. But this man went up when the sun was going
      down, and, as I say, continued there for a good long while after it was
      dark. You will want to know why. I will tell you. He wished to be alone.
      He hadn&rsquo;t a house of his own. He never had all the time he lived. He
      hadn&rsquo;t even a room of his own into which he could go, and bolt the door of
      it. True, he had kind friends, who gave him a bed: but they were all poor
      people, and their houses were small, and very likely they had large
      families, and he could not always find a quiet place to go into. And I
      dare say, if he had had a room, he would have been a little troubled with
      the children constantly coming to find him; for however much he loved them&mdash;and
      no man was ever so fond of children as he was&mdash;he needed to be left
      quiet sometimes. So, upon this occasion, he went up the mountain just to
      be quiet. He had been all day with a crowd of people, and he felt that it
      was time to be alone. For he had been talking with men all day, which
      tires and sometimes confuses a man&rsquo;s thoughts, and now he wanted to talk
      with God&mdash;for that makes a man strong, and puts all the confusion in
      order again, and lets a man know what he is about. So he went to the top
      of the hill. That was his secret chamber. It had no door; but that did not
      matter&mdash;no one could see him but God. There he stayed for hours&mdash;sometimes,
      I suppose, kneeling in his prayer to God; sometimes sitting, tired with
      his own thinking, on a stone; sometimes walking about, looking forward to
      what would come next&mdash;not anxious about it, but contemplating it. For
      just before he came up here, some of the people who had been with him
      wanted to make him a king; and this would not do&mdash;this was not what
      God wanted of him, and therefore he got rid of them, and came up here to
      talk to God. It was so quiet up here! The earth had almost vanished. He
      could see just the bare hilltop beneath him, a glimmer below, and the sky
      and the stars over his head. The people had all gone away to their own
      homes, and perhaps next day would hardly think about him at all, busy
      catching fish, or digging their gardens, or making things for their
      houses. But he knew that God would not forget him the next day any more
      than this day, and that God had sent him not to be the king that these
      people wanted him to be, but their servant. So, to make his heart strong,
      I say, he went up into the mountain alone to have a talk with his Father.
      How quiet it all was up here, I say, and how noisy it had been down there
      a little while ago! But God had been in the noise then as much as he was
      in the quiet now&mdash;the only difference being that he could not then be
      alone with him. I need not tell you who this man was&mdash;it was the king
      of men, the servant of men, the Lord Jesus Christ, the everlasting son of
      our Father in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this mountain on which he was praying had a small lake at the foot of
      it&mdash;that is, about thirteen miles long, and five miles broad. Not
      wanting even his usual companions to be with him this evening&mdash;partly,
      I presume, because they were of the same mind as those who desired to take
      him by force and make him a king&mdash;he had sent them away in their
      boat, to go across this water to the other side, where were their homes
      and their families. Now, it was not pitch dark either on the mountain-top
      or on the water down below; yet I doubt if any other man than he would
      have been keen-eyed enough to discover that little boat down in the middle
      of the lake, much distressed by the west wind that blew right in their
      teeth. But he loved every man in it so much, that I think even as he was
      talking to his Father, his eyes would now and then go looking for and
      finding it&mdash;watching it on its way across to the other side. You must
      remember that it was a little boat; and there are often tremendous storms
      upon these small lakes with great mountains about them. For the wind will
      come all at once, rushing down through the clefts in as sudden a squall as
      ever overtook a sailor at sea. And then, you know, there is no sea-room.
      If the wind get the better of them, they are on the shore in a few
      minutes, whichever way the wind may blow. He saw them worn out at the oar,
      toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them. So the time for
      loneliness and prayer was over, and the time to go down out of his secret
      chamber and help his brethren was come. He did not need to turn and say
      good-bye to his Father, as if he dwelt on that mountain-top alone: his
      Father was down there on the lake as well. He went straight down. Could
      not his Father, if he too was down on the lake, help them without him?
      Yes. But he wanted him to do it, that they might see that he did it.
      Otherwise they would only have thought that the wind fell and the waves
      lay down, without supposing for a moment that their Master or his Father
      had had anything to do with it. They would have done just as people do
      now-a-days: they think that the help comes of itself, instead of by the
      will of him who determined from the first that men should be helped. So
      the Master went down the hill. When he reached the border of the lake, the
      wind being from the other side, he must have found the waves breaking
      furiously upon the rocks. But that made no difference to him. He looked
      out as he stood alone on the edge amidst the rushing wind and the noise of
      the water, out over the waves under the clear, starry sky, saw where the
      tiny boat was tossed about like a nutshell, and set out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mariners had been staring at me up to this point, leaning forward on
      their benches, for sailors are nearly as fond of a good yarn as they are
      of tobacco; and I heard afterwards that they had voted parson&rsquo;s yarn a
      good one. Now, however, I saw one of them, probably more ignorant than the
      others, cast a questioning glance at his neighbour. It was not returned,
      and he fell again into a listening attitude. He had no idea of what was
      coming. He probably thought parson had forgotten to say how Jesus had come
      by a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The companions of our Lord had not been willing to go away and leave him
      behind. Now, I dare say, they wished more than ever that he had been with
      them&mdash;not that they thought he could do anything with a storm, only
      that somehow they would have been less afraid with his face to look at.
      They had seen him cure men of dreadful diseases; they had seen him turn
      water into wine&mdash;some of them; they had seen him feed five thousand
      people the day before with five loaves and two small fishes; but had one
      of their number suggested that if he had been with them, they would have
      been safe from the storm, they would not have talked any nonsense about
      the laws of nature, not having learned that kind of nonsense, but they
      would have said that was quite a different thing&mdash;altogether too much
      to expect or believe: <i>nobody</i> could make the wind mind what it was
      about, or keep the water from drowning you if you fell into it and
      couldn&rsquo;t swim; or such-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At length, when they were nearly worn out, taking feebler and feebler
      strokes, sometimes missing the water altogether, at other times burying
      their oars in it up to the handles&mdash;as they rose on the crest of a
      huge wave, one of them gave a cry, and they all stopped rowing and stared,
      leaning forward to peer through the darkness. And through the spray which
      the wind tore from the tops of the waves and scattered before it like
      dust, they saw, perhaps a hundred yards or so from the boat, something
      standing up from the surface of the water. It seemed to move towards them.
      It was a shape like a man. They all cried out with fear, as was natural,
      for they thought it must be a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How the faces of the sailors strained towards me at this part of the
      story! I was afraid one of them especially was on the point of getting up
      to speak, as we have heard of sailors doing in church. I went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then, over the noise of the wind and the waters came the voice they
      knew so well. It said, &lsquo;Be of good cheer: it is I. Be not afraid.&rsquo; I
      should think, between wonder and gladness, they hardly knew for some
      moments where they were or what they were about. Peter was the first to
      recover himself apparently. In the first flush of his delight he felt
      strong and full of courage. &lsquo;Lord, if it be thou,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;bid me come
      unto thee on the water.&rsquo; Jesus just said, &lsquo;Come;&rsquo; and Peter unshipped his
      oar, and scrambled over the gunwale on to the sea. But when he let go his
      hold of the boat, and began to look about him, and saw how the wind was
      tearing the water, and how it tossed and raved between him and Jesus, he
      began to be afraid. And as soon as he began to be afraid he began to sink;
      but he had, notwithstanding his fear, just sense enough to do the one
      sensible thing; he cried out, &lsquo;Lord, save me.&rsquo; And Jesus put out his hand,
      and took hold of him, and lifted him up out of the water, and said to him,
      &lsquo;O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And then they got
      into the boat, and the wind fell all at once, and altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you will not think that Peter was a coward, will you? It wasn&rsquo;t that
      he hadn&rsquo;t courage, but that he hadn&rsquo;t enough of it. And why was it that he
      hadn&rsquo;t enough of it? Because he hadn&rsquo;t faith enough. Peter was always very
      easily impressed with the look of things. It wasn&rsquo;t at all likely that a
      man should be able to walk on the water; and yet Peter found himself
      standing on the water: you would have thought that when once he found
      himself standing on the water, he need not be afraid of the wind and the
      waves that lay between him and Jesus. But they looked so ugly that the
      fearfulness of them took hold of his heart, and his courage went. You
      would have thought that the greatest trial of his courage was over when he
      got out of the boat, and that there was comparatively little more ahead of
      him. Yet the sight of the waves and the blast of the boisterous wind were
      too much for him. I will tell you how I fancy it was; and I think there
      are several instances of the same kind of thing in Peter&rsquo;s life. When he
      got out of the boat, and found himself standing on the water, he began to
      think much of himself for being able to do so, and fancy himself better
      and greater than his companions, and an especial favourite of God above
      them. Now, there is nothing that kills faith sooner than pride. The two
      are directly against each other. The moment that Peter grew proud, and
      began to think about himself instead of about his Master, he began to lose
      his faith, and then he grew afraid, and then he began to sink&mdash;and
      that brought him to his senses. Then he forgot himself and remembered his
      Master, and then the hand of the Lord caught him, and the voice of the
      Lord gently rebuked him for the smallness of his faith, asking, &lsquo;Wherefore
      didst thou doubt?&rsquo; I wonder if Peter was able to read his own heart
      sufficiently well to answer that <i>wherefore</i>. I do not think it
      likely at this period of his history. But God has immeasurable patience,
      and before he had done teaching Peter, even in this life, he had made him
      know quite well that pride and conceit were at the root of all his
      failures. Jesus did not point it out to him now. Faith was the only thing
      that would reveal that to him, as well as cure him of it; and was,
      therefore, the only thing he required of him in his rebuke. I suspect
      Peter was helped back into the boat by the eager hands of his companions
      already in a humbler state of mind than when he left it; but before his
      pride would be quite overcome, it would need that same voice of
      loving-kindness to call him Satan, and the voice of the cock to bring to
      his mind his loud boast, and his sneaking denial; nay, even the voice of
      one who had never seen the Lord till after his death, but was yet a
      readier disciple than he&mdash;the voice of St. Paul, to rebuke him
      because he dissembled, and was not downright honest. But at the last even
      he gained the crown of martyrdom, enduring all extremes, nailed to the
      cross like his Master, rather than deny his name. This should teach us to
      distrust ourselves, and yet have great hope for ourselves, and endless
      patience with other people. But to return to the story and what the story
      itself teaches us.

    <p>
      &ldquo;If the disciples had known that Jesus saw them from the top of the
      mountain, and was watching them all the time, would they have been
      frightened at the storm, as I have little doubt they were, for they were
      only fresh-water fishermen, you know? Well, to answer my own question&rdquo;&mdash;I
      went on in haste, for I saw one or two of the sailors with an audible
      answer hovering on their lips&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that, as they then were,
      it would have made so much difference to them; for none of them had risen
      much above the look of the things nearest them yet. But supposing you, who
      know something about him, were alone on the sea, and expecting your boat
      to be swamped every moment&mdash;if you found out all at once, that he was
      looking down at you from some lofty hilltop, and seeing all round about
      you in time and space too, would you be afraid? He might mean you to go to
      the bottom, you know. Would you mind going to the bottom with him looking
      at you? I do not think I should mind it myself. But I must take care lest
      I be boastful like Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we be afraid of anything with him looking at us who is the
      Saviour of men? But we are afraid of him instead, because we do not
      believe that he is what he says he is&mdash;the Saviour of men. We do not
      believe what he offers us is salvation. We think it is slavery, and
      therefore continue slaves. Friends, I will speak to you who think you do
      believe in him. I am not going to say that you do not believe in him; but
      I hope I am going to make you say to yourselves that you too deserve to
      have those words of the Saviour spoken to you that were spoken to Peter,
      &lsquo;O ye of little faith!&rsquo; Floating on the sea of your troubles, all kinds of
      fears and anxieties assailing you, is He not on the mountain-top? Sees he
      not the little boat of your fortunes tossed with the waves and the
      contrary wind? Assuredly he will come to you walking on the waters. It may
      not be in the way you wish, but if not, you will say at last, &lsquo;This is
      better.&rsquo; It may be that he will come in a form that will make you cry out
      for fear in the weakness of your faith, as the disciples cried out&mdash;not
      believing any more than they did, that it can be he. But will not each of
      you arouse his courage that to you also he may say, as to the woman with
      the sick daughter whose confidence he so sorely tried, &lsquo;Great is thy
      faith&rsquo;? Will you not rouse yourself, I say, that you may do him justice,
      and cast off the slavery of your own dread? O ye of little faith,
      wherefore will ye doubt? Do not think that the Lord sees and will not
      come. Down the mountain assuredly he will come, and you are now as safe in
      your troubles as the disciples were in theirs with Jesus looking on. They
      did not know it, but it was so: the Lord was watching them. And when you
      look back upon your past lives, cannot you see some instances of the same
      kind&mdash;when you felt and acted as if the Lord had forgotten you, and
      found afterwards that he had been watching you all the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the reason why you do not trust him more is that you obey him so
      little. If you would only, ask what God would have you to do, you would
      soon find your confidence growing. It is because you are proud, and
      envious, and greedy after gain, that you do not trust him more. Ah! trust
      him if it were only to get rid of these evil things, and be clean and
      beautiful in heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O sailors with me on the ocean of life, will you, knowing that he is
      watching you from his mountain-top, do and say the things that hurt, and
      wrong, and disappoint him? Sailors on the waters that surround this globe,
      though there be no great mountain that overlooks the little lake on which
      you float, not the less does he behold you, and care for you, and watch
      over you. Will you do that which is unpleasing, distressful to him? Will
      you be irreverent, cruel, coarse? Will you say evil things, lie, and
      delight in vile stories and reports, with his eye on you, watching your
      ship on its watery ways, ever ready to come over the waves to help you? It
      is a fine thing, sailors, to fear nothing; but it would be far finer to
      fear nothing <i>because</i> he is above all, and over all, and in you all.
      For his sake and for his love, give up everything bad, and take him for
      your captain. He will be both captain and pilot to you, and steer you safe
      into the port of glory. Now to God the Father,&rdquo; &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is very nearly the sermon I preached that first Sunday morning. I
      followed it up with a short enforcement in the afternoon.

      CHAPTER I. ANOTHER SUNDAY EVENING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening we met in Connie&rsquo;s room, as usual, to have our talk. And
      this is what came out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window was open. The sun was in the west. We sat a little aside out of
      the course of his radiance, and let him look full into the room. Only
      Wynnie sat back in a dark corner, as if she would get out of his way.
      Below him the sea lay bluer than you could believe even when you saw it&mdash;blue
      with a delicate yet deep silky blue, the exquisiteness of which was thrown
      up by the brilliant white lines of its lapping on the high coast, to the
      northward. We had just sat down, when Dora broke out with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Niceboots at church. He did stare at you, papa, as if he had never
      heard a sermon before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay he never heard such a sermon before!&rdquo; said Connie, with the
      perfect confidence of inexperience and partiality&mdash;not to say
      ignorance, seeing she had not heard the sermon herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Wynnie spoke from her dark corner, apparently forcing herself to
      speak, and thereby giving what seemed an unpleasant tone to what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa, I don&rsquo;t know what to think. You are always telling us to
      trust in Him; but how can we, if we are not good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first good thing you can do is to look up to him. That is the
      beginning of trust in him, and the most sensible thing that it is possible
      for us to do. That is faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no use sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you&mdash;I mean I&mdash;can&rsquo;t feel good, or care about it at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is that any ground for saying that it is no use&mdash;that he does
      not heed you? that he disregards the look cast up to him? that, till the
      heart goes with the will, he who made himself strong to be the helper of
      the weak, who pities most those who are most destitute&mdash;and who so
      destitute as those who do not love what they want to love&mdash;except,
      indeed, those who don&rsquo;t want to love?&mdash;that, till you are well on
      towards all right by earnestly seeking it, he won&rsquo;t help you? You are to
      judge him from yourself, are you?&mdash;forgetting that all the misery in
      you is just because you have not got his grand presence with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke so earnestly as to be somewhat incoherent in words. But my reader
      will understand. Wynnie was silent. Connie, as if partly to help her
      sister, followed on the same side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly how to say what I mean, papa, but I wish I could get
      this lovely afternoon, all full of sunshine and blue, into unity with all
      that you teach us about Jesus Christ. I wish this beautiful day came in
      with my thought of him, like the frame&mdash;gold and red and blue&mdash;that
      you have to that picture of him at home. Why doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because you have not enough of faith in him, my dear. You do not
      know him well enough yet. You do not yet believe that he means you all
      gladness, heartily, honestly, thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no suffering, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that, my dear. There you are on your couch and can&rsquo;t move.
      But he does mean you such gladness, such a full sunny air and blue sea of
      blessedness that this suffering shall count for little in it; nay more,
      shall be taken in for part, and, like the rocks that interfere with the
      roll of the sea, flash out the white that glorifies and intensifies the
      whole&mdash;to pass away by and by, I trust, none the less. What a chance
      you have, my Connie, of believing in him, of offering upon his altar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;are not these feelings in a great measure dependent
      upon the state of one&rsquo;s health? I find it so different when the sunshine
      is inside me as well as outside me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt of it, my dear. But that is only the more reason for rising
      above all that. From the way some people speak of physical difficulties&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t mean you, wife&mdash;you would think that they were not merely the
      inevitable which they are, but the insurmountable which they are not. That
      they are physical and not spiritual is not only a great consolation, but a
      strong argument for overcoming them. For all that is physical is put, or
      is in the process of being put, under the feet of the spiritual. Do not
      mistake me. I do not say you can make yourself feel merry or happy when
      you are in a physical condition which is contrary to such mental
      condition. But you can withdraw from it&mdash;not all at once; but by
      practice and effort you can learn to withdraw from it, refusing to allow
      your judgments and actions to be ruled by it. You can climb up out of the
      fogs, and sit quiet in the sunlight on the hillside of faith. You cannot
      be merry down below in the fog, for there is the fog; but you can every
      now and then fly with the dove-wings of the soul up into the clear, to
      remind yourself that all this passes away, is but an accident, and that
      the sun shines always, although it may not at any given moment be shining
      on you. &lsquo;What does that matter?&rsquo; you will learn to say. &lsquo;It is enough for
      me to know that the sun does shine, and that this is only a weary fog that
      is round about me for the moment. I shall come out into the light beyond
      presently.&rsquo; This is faith&mdash;faith in God, who is the light, and is all
      in all. I believe that the most glorious instances of calmness in
      suffering are thus achieved; that the sufferers really do not suffer what
      one of us would if thrown into their physical condition without the refuge
      of their spiritual condition as well; for they have taken refuge in the
      inner chamber. Out of the spring of their life a power goes forth that
      quenches the flames of the furnace of their suffering, so far at least
      that it does not touch the deep life, cannot make them miserable, does not
      drive them from the possession of their soul in patience, which is the
      divine citadel of the suffering. Do you understand me, Connie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, papa. I think perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still less, then, is the fact that the difficulty is physical to be used
      as an excuse for giving way to ill-temper, and, in fact, leaving ourselves
      to be tossed and shaken by every tremble of our nerves. That is as if a
      man should give himself into the hands and will and caprice of an
      organ-grinder, to work upon him, not with the music of the spheres, but
      with the wretched growling of the streets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Wynnie, &ldquo;I have heard you yourself, papa, make excuse for
      people&rsquo;s ill-temper on this very ground, that they were out of health.
      Indeed,&rdquo; she went on, half-crying, &ldquo;I have heard you do so for myself,
      when you did not know that I was within hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, most assuredly. It is no fiction, but a real difference
      that lies between excusing ourselves and excusing other people. No doubt
      the same excuse is just for ourselves that is just for other people. But
      we can do something to put ourselves right upon a higher principle, and
      therefore we should not waste our time in excusing, or even in condemning
      ourselves, but make haste up the hill. Where we cannot work&mdash;that is,
      in the life of another&mdash;we have time to make all the excuse we can.
      Nay more; it is only justice there. We are not bound to insist on our own
      rights, even of excuse; the wisest thing often is to forego them. But we
      are bound by heaven, earth, and hell to give them to other people. And,
      besides, what a comfort to ourselves to be able to say, &lsquo;It is true
      So-and-so was cross to-day. But it wasn&rsquo;t in the least that he wasn&rsquo;t
      friendly, or didn&rsquo;t like me; it was only that he had eaten something that
      hadn&rsquo;t agreed with him. I could see it in his eye. He had one of his
      headaches.&rsquo; Thus, you see, justice to our neighbour, and comfort to
      ourselves, is one and the same thing. But it would be a sad thing to have
      to think that when we found ourselves in the same ungracious condition,
      from whatever cause, we had only to submit to it, saying, &lsquo;It is a law of
      nature,&rsquo; as even those who talk most about laws will not do, when those
      laws come between them and their own comfort. They are ready enough then
      to call in the aid of higher laws, which, so far from being contradictory,
      overrule the lower to get things into something like habitable, endurable
      condition. It may be a law of nature; but what has the Law of the Spirit
      of Life to <i>propound anent</i> it? as the Scotch lawyers would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little pause followed, during which I hope some of us were thinking.
      That Wynnie, at least, was, her next question made evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say about a law of nature and a law of the Spirit makes me think
      again how that walking on the water has always been a puzzle to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could hardly be other, seeing that we cannot possibly understand it,&rdquo;
       I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I find it so hard to believe. Can&rsquo;t you say something, papa, to help
      me to believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think if you admit what goes before, you will find there is nothing
      against reason in the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, please, what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If all things were made by Jesus, the Word of God, would it be reasonable
      that the water that he had created should be able to drown him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might drown his body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would if he had not the power over it still, to prevent it from laying
      hold of him. But just think for a moment. God is a Spirit. Spirit is
      greater than matter. Spirit makes matter. Think what it was for a human
      body to have such a divine creative power dwelling in it as that which
      dwelt in the human form of Jesus! What power, and influence, and utter
      rule that spirit must have over the body in which it dwells! We cannot
      imagine how much; but if we have so much power over our bodies, how much
      more must the pure, divine Jesus, have had over his! I suspect this
      miracle was wrought, not through anything done to the water, but through
      the power of the spirit over the body of Jesus, which was all obedient
      thereto. I am not explaining the miracle, for that I cannot do. One day I
      think it will be plain common sense to us. But now I am only showing you
      what seems to me to bring us a step nearer to the essential region of the
      miracle, and so far make it easier to believe. If we look at the history
      of our Lord, we shall find that, true real human body as his was, it was
      yet used by his spirit after a fashion in which we cannot yet use our
      bodies. And this is only reasonable. Let me give you an instance. You
      remember how, on the Mount of Transfiguration, that body shone so that the
      light of it illuminated all his garments. You do not surely suppose that
      this shine was external&mdash;physical light, as we say, <i>merely?</i> No
      doubt it was physical light, for how else would their eyes have seen it?
      But where did it come from? What was its source? I think it was a natural
      outburst of glory from the mind of Jesus, filled with the perfect life of
      communion with his Father&mdash;the light of his divine blessedness taking
      form in physical radiance that permeated and glorified all that surrounded
      him. As the body is the expression of the soul, as the face of Jesus
      himself was the expression of the being, the thought, the love of Jesus in
      like manner this radiance was the natural expression of his gladness, even
      in the face of that of which they had been talking&mdash;Moses, Elias, and
      he&mdash;namely, the decease that he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
      Again, after his resurrection, he convinced the hands, as well as eyes, of
      doubting Thomas, that he was indeed there in the body; and yet that body
      could appear and disappear as the Lord willed. All this is full of marvel,
      I grant you; but probably far more intelligible to us in a further state
      of existence than some of the most simple facts with regard to our own
      bodies are to us now, only that we are so used to them that we never think
      how unintelligible they really are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then about Peter, papa? What you have been saying will not apply to
      Peter&rsquo;s body, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess there is more difficulty there. But if you can suppose that
      such power were indwelling in Jesus, you cannot limit the sphere of its
      action. As he is the head of the body, his church, in all spiritual
      things, so I firmly believe, however little we can understand about it, is
      he in all natural things as well. Peter&rsquo;s faith in him brought even
      Peter&rsquo;s body within the sphere of the outgoing power of the Master. Do you
      suppose that because Peter ceased to be brave and trusting, therefore
      Jesus withdrew from him some sustaining power, and allowed him to sink? I
      do not believe it. I believe Peter&rsquo;s sinking followed naturally upon his
      loss of confidence. Thus he fell away from the life of the Master; was no
      longer, in that way I mean, connected with the Head, was instantly under
      the dominion of the natural law of gravitation, as we call it, and began
      to sink. Therefore the Lord must take other means to save him. He must
      draw nigh to him in a bodily manner. The pride of Peter had withdrawn him
      from the immediate spiritual influence of Christ, conquering his matter;
      and therefore the Lord must come over the stormy space between, come
      nearer to him in the body, and from his own height of safety above the
      sphere of the natural law, stretch out to him the arm of physical aid,
      lift him up, lead him to the boat. The whole salvation of the human race
      is figured in this story. It is all Christ, my love.&mdash;Does this help
      you to believe at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it does, papa. But it wants thinking over a good deal. I always
      find as I think, that lighter bits shine out here and there in a thing I
      have no hope of understanding altogether. That always helps me to believe
      that the rest might be understood too, if I were only clever enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple enough, not clever enough, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that is more interesting to me
      than what you have been talking about. It is the other instances in the
      life of St. Peter in which you said he failed in a similar manner from
      pride or self-satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One, at least, seems to me very clear. You have often remarked to me,
      Ethel, how little praise servants can stand; how almost invariably after
      you have commended the diligence or skill of any of your household, as you
      felt bound to do, one of the first visible results was either a falling
      away in the performance by which she had gained the praise, or a more or
      less violent access, according to the nature of the individual, of
      self-conceit, soon breaking out in bad temper or impertinence. Now you
      will see precisely the same kind of thing in Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I opened my New Testament, and read fragmentarily, &ldquo;&lsquo;But whom say ye
      that I am?... Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.... Blessed
      art thou, Simon.... My Father hath revealed that unto thee. I will give
      unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.... I must suffer many things,
      and be killed, and be raised again the third day.... Be it far from thee,
      Lord. This shall not be unto thee.... Get thee behind me, Satan. Thou art
      an offence unto me.&rsquo; Just contemplate the change here in the words of our
      Lord. &lsquo;Blessed art thou.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou art an offence unto me.&rsquo; Think what change
      has passed on Peter&rsquo;s mood before the second of these words could be
      addressed to him to whom the first had just been spoken. The Lord had
      praised him. Peter grew self-sufficient, even to the rebuking of him whose
      praise had so uplifted him. But it is ever so. A man will gain a great
      moral victory: glad first, then uplifted, he will fall before a paltry
      temptation. I have sometimes wondered, too, whether his denial of our Lord
      had anything to do with his satisfaction with himself for making that
      onslaught upon the high priest&rsquo;s servant. It was a brave thing and a
      faithful to draw a single sword against a multitude. In his fiery
      eagerness and inexperience, the blow, well meant to cleave Malchus&rsquo;s head,
      missed, and only cut off his ear; but Peter had herein justified his
      confident saying that he would not deny him. He was not one to deny his
      Lord who had been the first to confess him! Yet ere the cock had crowed,
      ere the morning had dawned, the vulgar grandeur of the palace of the high
      priest (for let it be art itself, it was vulgar grandeur beside that
      grandeur which it caused Peter to deny), and the accusing tone of a
      maid-servant, were enough to make him quail whom the crowd with lanterns,
      and torches, and weapons, had only roused to fight. True, he was excited
      then, and now he was cold in the middle of the night, with Jesus gone from
      his sight a prisoner, and for the faces of friends that had there
      surrounded him and strengthened him with their sympathy, now only the
      faces of those who were, or whom at least Peter thought to be on the other
      side, looking at him curiously, as a strange intruder into their domains.
      Alas, that the courage which led him to follow the Lord should have thus
      led him, not to deny him, but into the denial of him! Yet why should I say
      <i>alas?</i> If the denial of our Lord lay in his heart a possible thing,
      only prevented by his being kept in favourable circumstances for
      confessing him, it was a thousand times better that he should deny him,
      and thus know what a poor weak thing that heart of his was, trust it no
      more, and give it up to the Master to make it strong, and pure, and grand.
      For such an end the Lord was willing to bear all the pain of Peter&rsquo;s
      denial. O, the love of that Son of Man, who in the midst of all the
      wretched weaknesses of those who surrounded him, loved the best in them,
      and looked forward to his own victory for them that they might become all
      that they were meant to be&mdash;like him; that the lovely glimmerings of
      truth and love that were in them now&mdash;the breakings forth of the
      light that lighteneth every man&mdash;might grow into the perfect human
      day; loving them even the more that they were so helpless, so oppressed,
      so far from that ideal which was their life, and which all their dim
      desires were reaching after!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I ceased, and a little overcome with the great picture in my soul to
      which I had been able only to give the poorest expression, rose, and
      retired to my own room. There I could only fall on my knees and pray that
      the Lord Christ, who had died for me, might have his own way with me&mdash;that
      it might be worth his while to have done what he did and what he was doing
      now for me. To my Elder Brother, my Lord, and my God, I gave myself yet
      again, confidently, because he cared to have me, and my very breath was
      his. I <i>would</i> be what he wanted, who knew all about it, and had done
      everything that I might be a son of God&mdash;a living glory of gladness.

      CHAPTER II. NICEBOOTS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning the captain of the lost vessel called upon me early to
      thank me for himself and his men. He was a fine honest-looking burly
      fellow, dressed in blue from head to heel. He might have sat for a
      portrait of Chaucer&rsquo;s shipman, as far as his hue and the first look of him
      went. It was clear that &ldquo;in many a tempest had his beard be shake,&rdquo; and
      certainly &ldquo;the hote somer had made his hew all broun;&rdquo; but farther the
      likeness would hardly go, for the &ldquo;good fellow&rdquo; which Chaucer applies with
      such irony to the shipman of his time, who would filch wine, and drown all
      the captives he made in a sea-fight, was clearly applicable in good
      earnest to this shipman. Still, I thought I had something to bring against
      him, and therefore before we parted I said to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me, captain, that your vessel was not seaworthy, and that you
      could not but have known that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was my own craft, sir, and I judged her fit for several voyages more.
      If she had been A 1 she couldn&rsquo;t have been mine; and a man must do what he
      can for his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were risking your life, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few chances more or less don&rsquo;t much signify to a sailor, sir. There
      ain&rsquo;t nothing to be done without risk. You&rsquo;ll find an old tub go voyage
      after voyage, and she beyond bail, and a clipper fresh off the stocks go
      down in the harbour. It&rsquo;s all in the luck, sir, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it were your own life I should have nothing to say, seeing you
      have a family to look after; but what about the poor fellows who made the
      voyage with you? Did they know what kind of a vessel they were embarking
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever the captain&rsquo;s ready to go he&rsquo;ll always find men ready to follow
      him. Bless you, sir, they never asks no questions. If a sailor was always
      to be thinking of the chances, he&rsquo;d never set his foot off shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right they shouldn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay they knowed all about the old brig as well as I did myself. You
      gets to know all about a craft just as you do about her captain. She&rsquo;s got
      a character of her own, and she can&rsquo;t hide it long, any more than you can
      hide yours, sir, begging your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay that&rsquo;s all correct, but still I shouldn&rsquo;t like anyone to say to
      me, &lsquo;You ought to have told me, captain.&rsquo; Therefore, you see, I&rsquo;m telling
      you, captain, and now I&rsquo;m clear.&mdash;Have a glass of wine before you
      go,&rdquo; I concluded, ringing the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. I&rsquo;ll turn over what you&rsquo;ve been saying, and anyhow I take
      it kind of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we parted. I have never seen him since, and shall not, most likely, in
      this world. But he looked like a man that could understand why and
      wherefore I spoke as I did. And I had the advantage of having had a chance
      of doing something for him first of all. Let no man who wants to do
      anything for the soul of a man lose a chance of doing something for his
      body. He ought to be willing, and ready, which is more than willing, to do
      that whether or not; but there are those who need this reminder. Of many a
      soul Jesus laid hold by healing the suffering the body brought upon it. No
      one but himself can tell how much the nucleus of the church was composed
      of and by those who had received health from his hands, loving-kindness
      from the word of his mouth. My own opinion is that herein lay the very
      germ of the kernel of what is now the ancient, was then the infant church;
      that from them, next to the disciples themselves, went forth the chief
      power of life in love, for they too had seen the Lord, and in their own
      humble way could preach and teach concerning him. What memories of him
      theirs must have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went on very quietly, that is, as I mean now, from the view-point
      of a historian, without much to record bearing notably upon after events,
      for the greater part of the next week. I wandered about my parish, making
      acquaintance with different people in an outside sort of way, only now and
      then finding an opportunity of seeing into their souls except by
      conclusion. But I enjoyed endlessly the aspects of the country. It was not
      picturesque except in parts. There was little wood and there were no
      hills, only undulations, though many of them were steep enough even from a
      pedestrian&rsquo;s point of view. Neither, however, were there any plains except
      high moorland tracts. But the impression of the whole country was large,
      airy, sunshiny, and it was clasped in the arms of the infinite, awful, yet
      how bountiful sea&mdash;if one will look at the ocean in its world-wide,
      not to say its eternal aspects, and not out of the fears of a hidebound
      love of life! The sea and the sky, I must confess, dwarfed the earth, made
      it of small account beside them; but who could complain of such an
      influence? At least, not I. My children bathed in this sea every day, and
      gathered strength and knowledge from it. It was, as I have indicated, a
      dangerous coast to bathe upon. The sweep of the tides varied with the
      varying sands that were cast up. There was now in one place, now in
      another, a strong <i>undertow</i>, as they called it&mdash;a reflux, that
      is, of the inflowing waters, which was quite sufficient to carry those who
      could not swim out into the great deep, and rendered much exertion
      necessary, even in those who could, to regain the shore. But there was a
      fine strong Cornish woman to take charge of the ladies and the little
      boys, and she, watching the ways of the wild monster, knew the when and
      the where, and all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie got out upon the downs every day. She improved in health certainly,
      and we thought a little even in her powers of motion. The weather
      continued superb. What rain there was fell at night, just enough for
      Nature to wash her face with and so look quite fresh in the morning. We
      contrived a dinner on the sands on the other side of the bay, for the
      Friday of this same week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning rose gloriously. Harry and Charlie were turning the house
      upside down, to judge by their noise, long before I was in the humour to
      get up, for I had been reading late the night before. I never made much
      objection to mere noise, knowing that I could stop it the moment I
      pleased, and knowing, which was of more consequence, that so far from
      there being anything wrong in making a noise, the sea would make noise
      enough in our ears before we left Kilkhaven. The moment, however, that I
      heard a thread of whining or a burst of anger in the noise, I would
      interfere at once&mdash;treating these just as things that must be
      dismissed at once. Harry and Charlie were, I say, to use their own form of
      speech, making such a row that morning, however, that I was afraid of some
      injury to the house or furniture, which were not our own. So I opened my
      door and called out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry! Charlie! What on earth are you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, papa,&rdquo; answered Charlie. &ldquo;Only it&rsquo;s so jolly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is jolly, my boy?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know, papa! It&rsquo;s <i>so</i> jolly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the sunshine?&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;and the wind? God&rsquo;s world all over? The
      God of gladness in the hearts of the lads? Is it that? No wonder, then,
      that they cannot tell yet what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I withdrew into my room; and so far from seeking to put an end to the
      noise&mdash;I knew Connie did not mind it&mdash;listened to it with a kind
      of reverence, as the outcome of a gladness which the God of joy had
      kindled in their hearts. Soon after, however, I heard certain dim growls
      of expostulation from Harry, and having, from experience, ground for
      believing that the elder was tyrannising over the younger, I stopped that
      and the noise together, sending Charlie to find out where the tide would
      be between one and two o&rsquo;clock, and Harry to run to the top of the hill,
      and find out the direction of the wind. Before I was dressed, Charlie was
      knocking at my door with the news that it would be half-tide about one;
      and Harry speedily followed with the discovery that the wind was
      north-east by south-west, which of course determined that the sun would
      shine all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dinner-hour drew near, the servants went over, with Walter at their
      head, to choose a rock convenient for a table, under the shelter of the
      rocks on the sands across the bay. Thither, when Walter returned, we bore
      our Connie, carrying her litter close by the edge of the retreating tide,
      which sometimes broke in a ripple of music under her, wetting our feet
      with innocuous rush. The child&rsquo;s delight was extreme, as she thus skimmed
      the edge of the ocean, with the little ones gambolling about her, and her
      mamma and Wynnie walking quietly on the landward side, for she wished to
      have no one between her and the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After scrambling with difficulty over some rocky ledges, and stopping at
      Connie&rsquo;s request, to let her look into a deep pool in the sand, which
      somehow or other retained the water after the rest had retreated, we set
      her down near the mouth of a cave, in the shadow of a rock. And there was
      our dinner nicely laid for us on a flat rock in front of the cave. The
      cliffs rose behind us, with curiously curved and variously angled strata.
      The sun in his full splendour threw dark shadows on the brilliant yellow
      sand, more and more of which appeared as the bright blue water withdrew
      itself, now rippling over it as if it meant to hide it all up again, now
      uncovering more as it withdrew for another rush. Before we had finished
      our dinner, the foremost wavelets appeared so far away over the plain of
      the sand, that it seemed a long walk to the edge that had been almost at
      our feet a little while ago. Between us and it lay a lovely desert of
      glittering sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      When even Charlie and Harry had arrived at the conclusion that it was time
      to stop eating, we left the shadow and went out into the sun, carrying
      Connie and laying her down in the midst of &ldquo;the ribbed sea-sand,&rdquo; which
      was very ribby to-day. On a shawl a little way off from her lay her baby,
      crowing and kicking with the same jollity that had possessed the boys ever
      since the morning. I wandered about with Wynnie on the sands, picking up
      amongst other things strange creatures in thin shells ending in
      vegetable-like tufts, if I remember rightly. My wife sat on the end of
      Connie&rsquo;s litter, and Dora and the boys, a little way off, were trying how
      far the full force of three wooden spades could, in digging a hole, keep
      ahead of the water which was ever tumbling in the sand from the sides of
      the same. Behind, the servants were busy washing the plates in a pool, and
      burying the fragments of the feast; for I made it a rule wherever we went
      that the fair face of nature was not to be defiled. I have always taken
      the part of excursionists in these latter days of running to and fro,
      against those who complain that the loveliest places are being destroyed
      by their inroads. But there is one most offensive, even disgusting habit
      amongst them&mdash;that of leaving bones, fragments of meat pies, and
      worse than all, pieces of greasy paper about the place, which I cannot
      excuse, or at least defend. Even the surface of Cumberland and
      Westmoreland lakes will be defiled with these floating abominations&mdash;not
      abominations at all if they are decently burned or buried when done with,
      but certainly abominations when left to be cast hither and thither in the
      wind, over the grass, or on the eddy and ripple of the pure water, for
      days after those who have thus left their shame behind them have returned
      to their shops or factories. I forgive them for trampling down the grass
      and the ferns. That cannot be helped, and in comparison of the good they
      get, is not to be considered at all. But why should they leave such a
      savage trail behind them as this, forgetting too that though they have
      done with the spot, there are others coming after them to whom these
      remnants must be an offence?
    </p>
    <p>
      At length in our roaming, Wynnie and I approached a long low ridge of
      rock, rising towards the sea into which it ran. Crossing this, we came
      suddenly upon the painter whom Dora had called Niceboots, sitting with a
      small easel before him. We were right above him ere we knew. He had his
      back towards us, so that we saw at once what he was painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa!&rdquo; cried Wynnie involuntarily, and the painter looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We came over from the other side, and did
      not see you before. I hope we have not disturbed you much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he answered courteously, and rose as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the subject on his easel suggested that of which Wynnie had
      been making a sketch at the same time, on the day when Connie first lay on
      the top of the opposite cliff. But he was not even looking in the same
      direction now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind having your work seen before it is finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least, if the spectators will do me the favour to remember
      that most processes have to go through a seemingly chaotic stage,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was struck with the mode and tone of the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is no common man,&rdquo; I said to myself, and responded to him in
      something of a similar style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could always keep that in mind with regard to human beings
      themselves, as well as their works,&rdquo; I said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter looked at me, and I looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We speak each from the experience of his own profession, I presume,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I returned, glancing at the little picture in oils upon his easel,
      &ldquo;your work here, though my knowledge of painting is next to nothing&mdash;perhaps
      I ought to say nothing at all&mdash;this picture must have long ago passed
      the chaotic stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nearly as much finished as I care to make it,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I
      hardly count this work at all. I am chiefly amusing, or rather pleasing,
      my own fancy at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;you had the conical rock outside the hay for
      your model, and now you are finishing it with your back turned towards it.
      How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will soon explain,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The moment I saw this rock, it
      reminded me of Dante&rsquo;s Purgatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are a reader of Dante?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In the original, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A friend of mine, a brother painter, an Italian, set me going with
      that, and once going with Dante, nobody could well stop. I never knew what
      intensity <i>per se</i> was till I began to read Dante.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite my own feeling. Now, to return to your picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without departing at all from natural forms, I thought to make it suggest
      the Purgatorio to anyone who remembered the description given of the place
      <i>ab extra</i> by Ulysses, in the end of the twenty-sixth canto of the
      Inferno. Of course, that thing there is a mere rock, yet it has certain
      mountain forms about it. I have put it at a much greater distance, you
      see, and have sought to make it look a solitary mountain in the midst of a
      great water. You will discover even now that the circles of the Purgatory
      are suggested without any approach, I think, to artificial structure; and
      there are occasional hints at figures, which you cannot definitely detach
      from the rocks&mdash;which, by the way, you must remember, were in one
      part full of sculptures. I have kept the mountain near enough, however, to
      indicate the great expanse of wild flowers on the top, which Matilda was
      so busy gathering. I want to indicate too the wind up there in the
      terrestrial paradise, ever and always blowing one way. You remember, Mr.
      Walton?&rdquo;&mdash;for the young man, getting animated, began to talk as if we
      had known each other for some time&mdash;and here he repeated the purport
      of Dante&rsquo;s words in English:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;An air of sweetness, changeless in its flow,
  With no more strength than in a soft wind lies,
  Smote peacefully against me on the brow.
  By which the leaves all trembling, level-wise,
  Did every one bend thitherward to where
  The high mount throws its shadow at sunrise.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said you did not use translations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it possible that&mdash;Miss Walton (?)&rdquo; interrogatively this&mdash;&ldquo;might
      not follow the Italian so easily, and I feared to seem pedantic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t lag far behind, I flatter myself,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Whose
      translation do you quote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment; then said carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have cobbled a few passages after that fashion myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has the merit of being near the original at least,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;and
      that seems to me one of the chief merits a translation can possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; the painter resumed, rather hastily, as if to avoid any further
      remark upon his verses, &ldquo;you see those white things in the air above?&rdquo;
       Here he turned to Wynnie. &ldquo;Miss Walton will remember&mdash;I think she was
      making a drawing of the rock at the same time I was&mdash;how the
      seagulls, or some such birds&mdash;only two or three of them&mdash;kept
      flitting about the top of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember quite well,&rdquo; answered Wynnie, with a look of appeal to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I interposed; &ldquo;my daughter, in describing what she had been
      attempting to draw, spoke especially of the birds over the rock. For she
      said the white lapping of the waves looked like spirits trying to get
      loose, and the white birds like foam that had broken its chains, and risen
      in triumph into the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Niceboots, for as yet I did not know what else to call him,
      looked at Wynnie almost with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderfully that falls in with my fancy about the rock!&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Purgatory indeed! with imprisoned souls lapping at its foot, and the free
      souls winging their way aloft in ether. Well, this world is a kind of
      purgatory anyhow&mdash;is it not, Mr. Walton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly it is. We are here tried as by fire, to see what our work is&mdash;whether
      wood, hay, and stubble, or gold and silver and precious stones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; resumed the painter, &ldquo;if anybody only glanced at my little
      picture, he would take those for sea-birds; but if he looked into it, and
      began to suspect me, he would find out that they were Dante and Beatrice
      on their way to the sphere of the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one respect at least, then, your picture has the merit of
      corresponding to fact; for what thing is there in the world, or what group
      of things, in which the natural man will not see merely the things of
      nature, but the spiritual man the things of the spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no theologian,&rdquo; said the painter, turning away, I thought somewhat
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I could see that Wynnie was greatly interested in him. Perhaps she
      thought that here was some enlightenment of the riddle of the world for
      her, if she could but get at what he was thinking. She was used to my way
      of it: here might be something new.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can be of any service to Miss Walton with her drawing, I shall be
      happy,&rdquo; he said, turning again towards me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his last gesture had made me a little distrustful of him, and I
      received his advances on this point with a coldness which I did not wish
      to make more marked than his own towards my last observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but Miss Walton does not presume to be an
      artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw a slight shade pass over Wynnie&rsquo;s countenance. When I turned to Mr.
      Niceboots, a shade of a different sort was on his. Surely I had said
      something wrong to cast a gloom on two young faces. I made haste to make
      amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are just going to have some coffee,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for my servants, I see,
      have managed to kindle a fire. Will you come and allow me to introduce you
      to Mrs. Walton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With much pleasure,&rdquo; he answered, rising from the rock whereon, as he
      spoke about his picture, he had again seated himself. He was a fine-built,
      black-bearded, sunburnt fellow, with clear gray eyes notwithstanding, a
      rather Roman nose, and good features generally. But there was an air of
      suppression, if not of sadness, about him, however, did not in the least
      interfere with the manliness of his countenance, or of its expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how am I to effect an introduction, seeing I do not yet
      know your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had had to keep a sharp look-out on myself lest I should call him Mr.
      Niceboots. He smiled very graciously and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Percivale&mdash;Charles Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A descendant of Sir Percivale of King Arthur&rsquo;s Round Table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot count quite so far back,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;as that&mdash;not quite
      to the Conquest,&rdquo; he added, with a slight deepening of his sunburnt hue.
      &ldquo;I do come of a fighting race, but I cannot claim Sir Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were now walking along the edge of the still retreating waves towards
      the group upon the sands, Mr. Percivale and I foremost, and Wynnie
      lingering behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, do look here papa!&rdquo; she cried, from some little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned and saw her gazing at something on the sand at her feet.
      Hastening back, we found it to be a little narrow line of foam-bubbles,
      which the water had left behind it on the sand, slowly breaking and
      passing out of sight. Why there should be foam-bubbles there then, and not
      always, I do not know. But there they were&mdash;and such colours! deep
      rose and grassy green and ultramarine blue; and, above all, one dark, yet
      brilliant and intensely-burnished, metallic gold. All of them were of a
      solid-looking burnished colour, like opaque body-colour laid on behind
      translucent crystal. Those little ocean bubbles were well worth turning to
      see; and so I said to Wynnie. But, as we gazed, they went on vanishing,
      one by one. Every moment a heavenly glory of hue burst, and was nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked away again towards the rest of our party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think those bubbles more beautiful than any precious stones you
      ever saw, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my love, I think they are, except it be the opal. In the opal, God
      seems to have fixed the evanescent and made the vanishing eternal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And flowers are more beautiful things than jewels?&rsquo; she said
      interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many&mdash;perhaps most flowers are,&rdquo; I granted. &ldquo;And did you ever see
      such curves and delicate textures anywhere else as in the clouds, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not&mdash;in the cirrhous clouds at least&mdash;the frozen ones.
      But what are you putting me to my catechism for in this way, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa, I could go on a long time with that catechism; but I will end
      with one question more, which you will perhaps find a little harder to
      answer. Only I daresay you have had an answer ready for years lest one of
      us should ask you some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my love. I never got an answer ready for anything lest one of my
      children should ask me. But it is not surprising either that children
      should be puzzled about the things that have puzzled their father, or that
      by the time they are able to put the questions, he should have found out
      some sort of an answer to most of them. Go on with your catechism, Wynnie.
      Now for your puzzle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a funny question, papa; it&rsquo;s a very serious one. I can&rsquo;t think
      why the unchanging God should have made all the most beautiful things
      wither and grow ugly, or burst and vanish, or die somehow and be no more.
      Mamma is not so beautiful as she once was, is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one way, no; but in another and better way, much more so. But we will
      not talk about her kind of beauty just now; we will keep to the more
      material loveliness of which you have been speaking&mdash;though, in
      truth, no loveliness can be only material. Well, then, for my answer; it
      is, I think, because God loves the beauty so much that he makes all
      beautiful things vanish quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay not, my dear. But I will explain to you a little, if Mr.
      Percivale will excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am greatly interested, both in the question and the
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Wynnie; everything has a soul and a body, or something like
      them. By the body we know the soul. But we are always ready to love the
      body instead of the soul. Therefore, God makes the body die continually,
      that we may learn to love the soul indeed. The world is full of beautiful
      things, but God has saved many men from loving the mere bodies of them, by
      making them poor; and more still by reminding them that if they be as rich
      as Croesus all their lives, they will be as poor as Diogenes&mdash;poorer,
      without even a tub&mdash;when this world, with all its pictures, scenery,
      books, and&mdash;alas for some Christians!&mdash;bibles even, shall have
      vanished away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say <i>alas</i>, papa&mdash;if they are Christians
      especially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say <i>alas</i> only from their point of view, not from mine. I mean
      such as are always talking and arguing from the Bible, and never giving
      themselves any trouble to do what it tells them. They insist on the anise
      and cummin, and forget the judgment, mercy, and faith. These worship the
      body of the truth, and forget the soul of it. If the flowers were not
      perishable, we should cease to contemplate their beauty, either blinded by
      the passion for hoarding the bodies of them, or dulled by the hebetude of
      commonplaceness that the constant presence of them would occasion. To
      compare great things with small, the flowers wither, the bubbles break,
      the clouds and sunsets pass, for the very same holy reason, in the degree
      of its application to them, for which the Lord withdrew from his disciples
      and ascended again to his Father&mdash;that the Comforter, the Spirit of
      Truth, the Soul of things, might come to them and abide with them, and so
      the Son return, and the Father be revealed. The flower is not its
      loveliness, and its loveliness we must love, else we shall only treat them
      as flower-greedy children, who gather and gather, and fill hands and
      baskets, from a mere desire of acquisition, excusable enough in them, but
      the same in kind, however harmless in mode, and degree, and object, as the
      avarice of the miser. Therefore God, that we may always have them, and
      ever learn to love their beauty, and yet more their truth, sends the
      beneficent winter that we may think about what we have lost, and welcome
      them when they come again with greater tenderness and love, with clearer
      eyes to see, and purer hearts to understand, the spirit that dwells in
      them. We cannot do without the &lsquo;winter of our discontent.&rsquo; Shakspere
      surely saw that when he makes Titania say, in <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The human mortals want their winter here&rsquo;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      namely, to set things right; and none of those editors who would alter the
      line seem to have been capable of understanding its import.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand you a little,&rdquo; answered Wynnie. Then, changing her
      tone, &ldquo;I told you, papa, you would have an answer ready; didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child; but with this difference&mdash;I found the answer to meet
      my own necessities, not yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you had it ready for me when I wanted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. That is the only certainty you have in regard to what you give
      away. No one who has not tasted it and found it good has a right to offer
      any spiritual dish to his neighbour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percivale took no part in our conversation. The moment I had presented
      him to Mrs. Walton and Connie, and he had paid his respects by a somewhat
      stately old-world obeisance, he merged the salutation into a farewell,
      and, either forgetting my offer of coffee, or having changed his mind,
      withdrew, a little to my disappointment, for, notwithstanding his lack of
      response where some things he said would have led me to expect it, I had
      begun to feel much interested in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was scarcely beyond hearing, when Dora came up to me from her digging,
      with an eager look on her sunny face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he got nice boots, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my dear, I am unable to support you in that assertion, for I
      never saw his boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, then,&rdquo; returned the child; &ldquo;and I never saw such nice boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept the statement willingly,&rdquo; I replied; and we heard no more of the
      boots, for his name was now substituted for his nickname. Nor did I see
      himself again for some days&mdash;not in fact till next Sunday&mdash;though
      why he should come to church at all was something of a puzzle to me,
      especially when I knew him better.

      CHAPTER III. THE BLACKSMITH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day I set out after breakfast to inquire about a blacksmith. It
      was not every or any blacksmith that would do. I must not fix on the first
      to do my work because he was the first. There was one in the village, I
      soon learned; but I found him an ordinary man, who, I have no doubt, could
      shoe a horse and avoid the quick, but from whom any greater delicacy of
      touch was not to be expected. Inquiring further, I heard of a young smith
      who had lately settled in a hamlet a couple of miles distant, but still
      within the parish. In the afternoon I set out to find him. To my surprise,
      he was a pale-faced, thoughtful-looking man, with a huge frame, which
      appeared worn rather than naturally thin, and large eyes that looked at
      the anvil as if it was the horizon of the world. He had got a horse-shoe
      in his tongs when I entered. Notwithstanding the fire that glowed on the
      hearth, and the sparks that flew like a nimbus in eruption from about his
      person, the place looked very dark to me entering from the glorious blaze
      of the almost noontide sun, and felt cool after the deep lane through
      which I had come, and which had seemed a very reservoir of sunbeams. I
      could see the smith by the glow of his horse-shoe; but all between me and
      the shoe was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It is a good thing to find a man by his work. I
      heard you half a mile off or so, and now I see you, but only by the glow
      of your work. It is a grand thing to work in fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hammered hand to his forehead courteously, and as lightly as
      if the hammer had been the butt-end of a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you would say the same if you had to work at it in
      weather like this,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;that would be the fault of my weakness, and
      would not affect the assertion I have just made, that it is a fine thing
      to work in fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may be right,&rdquo; he rejoined with a sigh, as, throwing the
      horse-shoe he had been fashioning from the tongs on the ground, he next
      let the hammer drop beside the anvil, and leaning against it held his head
      for a moment between his hands, and regarded the floor. &ldquo;It does not much
      matter to me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if I only get through my work and have done
      with it. No man shall say I shirked what I&rsquo;d got to do. And then when it&rsquo;s
      over there won&rsquo;t be a word to say agen me, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence. And now I could see the sunlight lying in
      a somewhat dreary patch, if the word <i>dreary</i> can be truly used with
      respect to any manifestation of sunlight, on the dark clay floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not ill,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but taking up his tongs caught with it from a beam one
      of a number of roughly-finished horse-shoes which hung there, and put it
      on the fire to be fashioned to a certain fit. While he turned it in the
      fire, and blew the bellows, I stood regarding him. &ldquo;This man will do for
      my work,&rdquo; I said to myself; &ldquo;though I should not wonder from the look of
      him if it was the last piece of work he ever did under the New Jerusalem.&rdquo;
       The smith&rsquo;s words broke in on my meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a little boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I once wanted to stay at home from
      school. I had, I believe, a little headache, but nothing worth minding. I
      told my mother that I had a headache, and she kept me, and I helped her at
      her spinning, which was what I liked best of anything. But in the
      afternoon the Methodist preacher came in to see my mother, and he asked me
      what was the matter with me, and my mother answered for me that I had a
      bad head, and he looked at me; and as my head was quite well by this time,
      I could not help feeling guilty. And he saw my look, I suppose, sir, for I
      can&rsquo;t account for what he said any other way; and he turned to me, and he
      said to me, solemn-like, &lsquo;Is your head bad enough to send you to the Lord
      Jesus to make you whole?&rsquo; I could not speak a word, partly from
      bashfulness, I suppose, for I was but ten years old. So he followed it up,
      as they say: &lsquo;Then you ought to be at school,&rsquo; says he. I said nothing,
      because I couldn&rsquo;t. But never since then have I given in as long as I
      could stand. And I can stand now, and lift my hammer, too,&rdquo; he said, as he
      took the horse-shoe from the forge, laid it on the anvil, and again made a
      nimbus of coruscating iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the man I want,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a job for you, down to
      Kilkhaven, as you say in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, sir? Something about the church? I should ha&rsquo; thought the
      church was all spick and span by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you know who I am,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go to church myself, being brought
      up a Methodist; but anything that happens in the parish is known the next
      day all over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind doing my job though you are a Methodist, will you?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sir. If I&rsquo;ve read right, it&rsquo;s the fault of the Church that we
      don&rsquo;t pull all alongside. You turned us out, sir; we didn&rsquo;t go out of
      ourselves. At least, if all they say is true, which I can&rsquo;t be sure of,
      you know, in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right there though,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And in doing so, the
      Church had the worst of it&mdash;as all that judge and punish their
      neighbours have. But you have been the worse for it, too: all of which is
      to be laid to the charge of the Church. For there is not one clergyman I
      know&mdash;mind, I say, that I know&mdash;who would have made such a cruel
      speech to a boy as that the Methodist parson made to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it did me good, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that? I am not. Are you sure, first of all, it did not
      make you proud? Are you sure it has not made you work beyond your strength&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t mean your strength of arm, for clearly that is all that could be
      wished, but of your chest, your lungs? Is there not some danger of your
      leaving someone who is dependent on you too soon unprovided for? Is there
      not some danger of your having worked as if God were a hard master?&mdash;of
      your having worked fiercely, indignantly, as if he wronged you by not
      caring for you, not understanding you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned me no answer, but hammered momently on his anvil. Whether he
      felt what I meant, or was offended at my remark, I could not then tell. I
      thought it best to conclude the interview with business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a delicate little job that wants nice handling, and I fancy you
      are just the man to do it to my mind,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo; he asked, in a friendly manner enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me, I would rather show it to you than talk about it,&rdquo;
       I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please, sir. When do you want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first hour you can come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel inclined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matter, I&rsquo;d rather go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me instead: it&rsquo;s light work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir&mdash;at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was arranged.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE LIFE-BOAT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day rose glorious. Indeed, early as the sun rose, I saw him rise&mdash;saw
      him, from the down above the house, over the land to the east and north,
      ascend triumphant into his own light, which had prepared the way for him;
      while the clouds that hung over the sea glowed out with a faint flush, as
      anticipating the hour when the west should clasp the declining glory in a
      richer though less dazzling splendour, and shine out the bride of the
      bridegroom east, which behold each other from afar across the intervening
      world, and never mingle but in the sight of the eyes. The clear pure light
      of the morning made me long for the truth in my heart, which alone could
      make me pure and clear as the morning, tune me up to the concert-pitch of
      the nature around me. And the wind that blew from the sunrise made me hope
      in the God who had first breathed into my nostrils the breath of life,
      that he would at length so fill me with his breath, his wind, his spirit,
      that I should think only his thoughts and live his life, finding therein
      my own life, only glorified infinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast and prayers, I would go to the church to await the arrival
      of my new acquaintance the smith. In order to obtain entrance, I had,
      however, to go to the cottage of the sexton. This was not my first visit
      there, so that I may now venture to take my reader with me. To reach the
      door, I had to cross a hollow by a bridge, built, for the sake of the
      road, over what had once been the course of a rivulet from the heights
      above. Now it was a kind of little glen, or what would in Scotland be
      called a den, I think, grown with grass and wild flowers and ferns, some
      of them, rare and fine. The roof of the cottage came down to the road,
      and, until you came quite near, you could not but wonder where the body
      that supported this head could be. But you soon saw that the ground fell
      suddenly away, leaving a bank against which the cottage was built.
      Crossing a garden of the smallest, the principal flowers of which were the
      stonecrop on its walls, by a flag-paved path, you entered the building,
      and, to your surprise, found yourself, not in a little cottage kitchen, as
      you expected, but in a waste-looking space, that seemed to have forgotten
      the use for which it had been built. There was a sort of loft along one
      side of it, and it was heaped with indescribable lumber-looking stuff with
      here and there a hint at possible machinery. The place had been a mill for
      grinding corn, and its wheel had been driven by the stream which had run
      for ages in the hollow of which I have already spoken. But when the canal
      came to be constructed, the stream had to be turned aside from its former
      course, and indeed was now employed upon occasion to feed the canal; so
      that the mill of necessity had fallen into disuse and decay. Crossing this
      floor, you entered another door, and turning sharp to the left, went down
      a few steps of a ladder-sort of stair, and after knocking your hat against
      a beam, emerged in the comfortable quaint little cottage kitchen you had
      expected earlier. A cheerful though small fire burns in the grate&mdash;for
      even here the hearth-fire has vanished from the records of cottage-life&mdash;and
      is pleasant here even in the height of summer, though it is counted
      needful only for cooking purposes. The ceiling, which consists only of the
      joists and the boards that floor the bedroom above, is so low, that
      necessity, if not politeness, would compel you to take off your
      already-bruised hat. Some of these joists, you will find, are made further
      useful by supporting each a shelf, before which hangs a little curtain of
      printed cotton, concealing the few stores and postponed eatables of the
      house&mdash;forming, in fact, both store-room and larder of the family. On
      the walls hang several coloured prints, and within a deep glazed frame the
      figure of a ship in full dress, carved in rather high relief in sycamore.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I now entered, Mrs. Coombes rose from a high-backed settle near the
      fire, and bade me good-morning with a courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely day it is, Mrs. Coombes! It is so bright over the sea,&rdquo; I
      said, going to the one little window which looked out on the great
      Atlantic, &ldquo;that one almost expects a great merchant navy to come sailing
      into Kilkhaven&mdash;sunk to the water&rsquo;s edge with silks, and ivory, and
      spices, and apes, and peacocks, like the ships of Solomon that we read
      about&mdash;just as the sun gets up to the noonstead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I record her answer, I turn to my reader, who in the spirit
      accompanies me, and have a little talk with him. I always make it a rule
      to speak freely with the less as with the more educated of my friends. I
      never <i>talk down</i> to them, except I be expressly explaining something
      to them. The law of the world is as the law of the family. Those children
      grow much the faster who hear all that is going on in the house. Reaching
      ever above themselves, they arrive at an understanding at fifteen, which,
      in the usual way of things, they would not reach before five-and-twenty or
      thirty; and this in a natural way, and without any necessary priggishness,
      except such as may belong to their parents. Therefore I always spoke to
      the poor and uneducated as to my own people,&mdash;freely, not much caring
      whether I should be quite understood or not; for I believed in influences
      not to be measured by the measure of the understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was the old woman&rsquo;s answer? It was this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, sir. And when I was as young as you&rdquo;&mdash;I was not so very
      young, my reader may well think&mdash;&ldquo;I thought like that about the sea
      myself. Everything come from the sea. For my boy Willie he du bring me
      home the beautifullest parrot and the talkingest you ever see, and the red
      shawl all worked over with flowers: I&rsquo;ll show it to you some day, sir,
      when you have time. He made that ship you see in the frame there, sir, all
      with his own knife, out on a bit o&rsquo; wood that he got at the Marishes, as
      they calls it, sir&mdash;a bit of an island somewheres in the great sea.
      But the parrot&rsquo;s gone dead like the rest of them, sir.&mdash;Where am I?
      and what am I talking about?&rdquo; she added, looking down at her knitting as
      if she had dropped a stitch, or rather as if she had forgotten what she
      was making, and therefore what was to come next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were telling me how you used to think of the sea&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was as young as you. I remember, sir. Well, that lasted a long
      time&mdash;lasted till my third boy fell asleep in the wide water; for it
      du call it falling asleep, don&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Bible certainly does,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Bible I be meaning, of course,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Well, after that,
      but I don&rsquo;t know what began it, only I did begin to think about the sea as
      something that took away things and didn&rsquo;t bring them no more. And somehow
      or other she never look so blue after that, and she give me the shivers.
      But now, sir, she always looks to me like one o&rsquo; the shining ones that
      come to fetch the pilgrims. You&rsquo;ve heard tell of the <i>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>,
      I daresay, sir, among the poor people; for they du say it was written by a
      tinker, though there be a power o&rsquo; good things in it that I think the
      gentlefolk would like if they knowed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know the book&mdash;nearly as well as I know the Bible,&rdquo; I answered;
      &ldquo;and the shining ones are very beautiful in it. I am glad you can think of
      the sea that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s looking in at the window all day as I go about the house,&rdquo; she
      answered, &ldquo;and all night too when I&rsquo;m asleep; and if I hadn&rsquo;t learned to
      think of it that way, it would have driven me mad, I du believe. I was
      forced to think that way about it, or not think at all. And that wouldn&rsquo;t
      be easy, with the sound of it in your ears the last thing at night and the
      first thing in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth of things is indeed the only refuge from the look of things,&rdquo; I
      replied. &ldquo;But now I want the key of the church, if you will trust me with
      it, for I have something to do there this morning; and the key of the
      tower as well, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her old smile, ripened only by age, she reached the ponderous keys
      from the nail where they hung, and gave them into my hand. I left her in
      the shadow of her dwelling, and stepped forth into the sunlight. The first
      thing I observed was the blacksmith waiting for me at the church door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I saw him in the full light of day, and now that he wore his
      morning face upon which the blackness of labour had not yet gathered, I
      could see more plainly how far he was from well. There was a flush on his
      thin cheek by which the less used exercise of walking revealed his inward
      weakness, and the light in his eyes had something of the far-country in
      them&mdash;&ldquo;the light that never was on sea or shore.&rdquo; But his speech was
      cheerful, for he had been walking in the light of this world, and that had
      done something to make the light within him shine a little more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you find yourself to-day?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, sir, I thank you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A day like this does a man
      good. But,&rdquo; he added, and his countenance fell, &ldquo;the heart knoweth its own
      bitterness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may know it too much,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;just because it refuses to let a
      stranger intermeddle therewith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply. I turned the key in the great lock, and the iron-studded
      oak opened and let us into the solemn gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not require many minutes to make the man understand what I wanted
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must begin at the bells and work down,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we went up into the tower, where, with the help of a candle I fetched
      for him from the cottage, he made a good many minute measurements; found
      that carpenter&rsquo;s work was necessary for the adjustment of the hammers and
      cranks and the leading of the rods, undertook the management of the whole,
      and in the course of an hour and a half went home to do what had to be
      done before any fixing could be commenced, assuring me that he had no
      doubt of bringing the job to a satisfactory conclusion, although the force
      of the blow on the bell would doubtless have to be regulated afterwards by
      repeated trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a fortnight, I hope you will be able to play a tune to the parish,
      sir,&rdquo; he added, as he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I resolved, if possible, to know more of the man, and find out his
      trouble, if haply I might be able to give him any comfort, for I was all
      but certain that there was a deeper cause for his gloom than the state of
      his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone I stood with the key of the church in my hand, and looked
      about me. Nature at least was in glorious health&mdash;sunshine in her
      eyes, light fantastic cloud-images passing through her brain, her breath
      coming and going in soft breezes perfumed with the scents of meadows and
      wild flowers, and her green robe shining in the motions of her gladness. I
      turned to lock the church door, though in my heart I greatly disapproved
      of locking the doors of churches, and only did so now because it was not
      my church, and I had no business to force my opinions upon other customs.
      But when I turned I received a kind of questioning shock. There was the
      fallen world, as men call it, shining in glory and gladness, because God
      was there; here was the way into the lost Paradise, yea, the door into an
      infinitely higher Eden than that ever had or ever could have been,
      iron-clamped and riveted, gloomy and low-browed like the entrance to a
      sepulchre, and surrounded with the grim heads of grotesque monsters of the
      deep. What did it mean? Here was contrast enough to require harmonising,
      or if that might not be, then accounting for. Perhaps it was enough to say
      that although God made both the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of
      grace, yet the symbol of the latter was the work of man, and might not
      altogether correspond to God&rsquo;s idea of the matter. I turned away
      thoughtful, and went through the churchyard with my eye on the graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I left the churchyard, still looking to the earth, the sound of voices
      reached my ear. I looked up. There, down below me, at the foot of the high
      bank on which I stood, lay a gorgeous shining thing upon the bosom of the
      canal, full of men, and surrounded by men, women, and children, delighting
      in its beauty. I had never seen such a thing before, but I knew at once,
      as by instinct, which of course it could not have been, that it was the
      life-boat. But in its gorgeous colours, red and white and green, it looked
      more like the galley that bore Cleopatra to Actium. Nor, floating so light
      on the top of the water, and broad in the beam withal, curved upward and
      ornamented at stern and stem, did it look at all like a creature formed to
      battle with the fierce elements. A pleasure-boat for floating between
      river banks it seemed, drawn by swans mayhap, and regarded in its course
      by fair eyes from green terrace-walks, or oriel windows of ancient houses
      on verdant lawns. Ten men sat on the thwarts, and one in the stern by the
      yet useless rudder, while men and boys drew the showy thing by a rope
      downward to the lock-gates. The men in the boat, wore blue jerseys, but
      you could see little of the colour for strange unshapely things that they
      wore above them, like an armour cut out of a row of organ pipes. They were
      their cork-jackets; for every man had to be made into a life-boat himself.
      I descended the bank, and stood on the edge of the canal as it drew near.
      Then I saw that every oar was loosely but firmly fastened to the rowlock,
      so that it could be dropped and caught again in a moment; and that the gay
      sides of the unwieldy-looking creature were festooned with ropes from the
      gunwale, for the men to lay hold of when she capsized, for the earlier
      custom of fastening the men to their seats had been quite given up,
      because their weight under the water might prevent the boat from righting
      itself again, and the men could not come to the surface. Now they had a
      better chance in their freedom, though why they should not be loosely
      attached to the boat, I do not quite see.
    </p>
    <p>
      They towed the shining thing through the upper gate of the lock, and
      slowly she sank from my sight, and for some moments was no more to be
      seen, for I had remained standing where first she passed me. All at once
      there she was beyond the covert of the lock-head, abroad and free,
      fleeting from the strokes of ten swift oars over the still waters of the
      bay towards the waves that roared further out where the ground-swell was
      broken by the rise of the sandy coast. There was no vessel in danger now,
      as the talk of the spectators informed me; it was only for exercise and
      show that they went out. It seemed all child&rsquo;s play for a time; but when
      they got among the broken waves, then it looked quite another thing. The
      motion of the waters laid hold upon her, and soon tossed her fearfully,
      now revealing the whole of her capacity on the near side of one of their
      slopes, now hiding her whole bulk in one of their hollows beyond. She,
      careless as a child in the troubles of the world, floated about amongst
      them with what appeared too much buoyancy for the promise of a safe
      return. Again and again she was driven from her course towards the low
      rocks on the other side of the bay, and again and again, returned to
      disport herself, like a sea-animal, as it seemed, upon the backs of the
      wild, rolling, and bursting billows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can she go no further?&rdquo; I asked of the captain of the coastguard, whom I
      found standing by my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not without some danger,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, must it be in a storm!&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then of course,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;they must take their chance. But there is
      no good in running risks for nothing. That swell is quite enough for
      exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it enough to accustom them to face the danger that will come?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With danger comes courage,&rdquo; said the old sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I don&rsquo;t think I ever was afraid. Yes, I believe I was once for
      one moment, no more, when I fell from the maintop-gallant yard, and felt
      myself falling. But it was soon over, for I only fell into the maintop. I
      was expecting the smash on deck when I was brought up there. But,&rdquo; he
      resumed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much about the life-boat. My rockets are worth a
      good deal more, as you may see, sir, before the winter is over; for seldom
      does a winter pass without at least two or three wrecks close by here on
      this coast. The full force of the Atlantic breaks here, sir. I <i>have</i>
      seen a life-boat&mdash;not that one&mdash;<i>she&rsquo;s</i> done nothing yet&mdash;pitched
      stern over stem; not capsized, you know, sir, in the ordinary way, but
      struck by a wave behind while she was just hanging in the balance on the
      knife-edge of a wave, and flung a somerset, as I say, stern over stem, and
      four of her men lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we spoke I saw on the pier-head the tall figure of the painter
      looking earnestly at the boat. I thought he was regarding it chiefly from
      an artistic point of view, but I became aware before long that that would
      not have been consistent with the character of Charles Percivale. He had
      been, I learned afterwards, a crack oarsman at Oxford, and had belonged to
      the University boat, so that he had some almost class-sympathy with the
      doings of the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little while the boat sped swiftly back, entered the lock, was lifted
      above the level of the storm-heaved ocean, and floated up the smooth canal
      calmly as if she had never known what trouble was. Away up to the pretty
      little Tudor-fashioned house in which she lay&mdash;one could almost fancy
      dreaming of storms to come&mdash;she went, as softly as if moved only by
      her &ldquo;own sweet will,&rdquo; in the calm consolation for her imprisonment of
      having tried her strength, and found therein good hope of success for the
      time when she should rush to the rescue of men from that to which, as a
      monster that begets monsters, she a watching Perseis, lay ready to offer
      battle. The poor little boat lying in her little house watching the ocean,
      was something signified in my eyes, and not less so after what came in the
      course of changing seasons and gathered storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time I had the keys in my hand, and now went back to the cottage
      to restore them to their place upon the wall. When I entered there was a
      young woman of a sweet interesting countenance talking to Mrs. Coombes.
      Now as it happened, I had never yet seen the daughter who lived with her,
      and thought this was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found your daughter at last then?&rdquo; I said, approaching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, sir. She goes out to work, and her hands be pretty full at
      present. But this be almost my daughter, sir,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;This is my next
      daughter, Mary Trehern, from the south. She&rsquo;s got a place near by, to be
      near her mother that is to be, that&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was hanging her head and blushing, as the old woman spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And when are you going to get your new mother,
      Mary? Soon I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she gave me no reply&mdash;only hung her head lower and blushed
      deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coombes spoke for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s shy, you see, sir. But if she was to speak her mind, she would ask
      you whether you wouldn&rsquo;t marry her and Willie when he comes home from his
      next voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s hands were trembling now, and she turned half away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl tried to turn towards me, but could not. I looked at her face a
      little more closely. Through all its tremor, there was a look of constancy
      that greatly pleased me. I tried to make her speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you expect Willie home?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little gasp and murmur, but no articulate words came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Mary,&rdquo; said her mother, as I found she always called
      her. &ldquo;The gentleman won&rsquo;t be sharp with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a pair of soft brown eyes with one glance and a smile, and then
      sank them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be home in about a month, we think,&rdquo; answered the mother. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a
      good ship he&rsquo;s aboard of, and makes good voyages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time to think about the bans, then,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come to me about it, and I will attend to it&mdash;when you think
      proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought I could hear a murmured &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; from the girl, but I
      could not be certain that she spoke. I shook hands with them, and went for
      a stroll on the other side of the bay.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. MR. PERCIVALE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I reached home I found that Connie was already on her watch-tower.
      For while I was away, they had carried her out that she might see the
      life-boat. I followed her, and found the whole family about her couch, and
      with them Mr. Percivale, who was showing her some sketches that he had
      made in the neighbourhood. Connie knew nothing of drawing; but she seemed
      to me always to catch the feeling of a thing. Her remarks therefore were
      generally worth listening to, and Mr. Percivale was evidently interested
      in them. Wynnie stood behind Connie, looking over her shoulder at the
      drawing in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you get that shade of green?&rdquo; I heard her ask as I came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mr. Percivale proceeded to tell her; from which beginning they
      went on to other things, till Mr. Percivale said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is hardly fair, Miss Walton; to criticise my work while you keep
      your own under cover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t criticising, Mr. Percivale; was I, Connie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear her make a single remark, Mr. Percivale,&rdquo; said Connie,
      taking her sister&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my surprise they were talking away with the young man as if they had
      known him for years, and my wife was seated at the foot of the couch,
      apparently taking no exception to the suddenness of the intimacy. I am
      afraid, when I think of it, that a good many springs would be missing from
      the world&rsquo;s history if they might not flow till the papas gave their wise
      consideration to everything about the course they were to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, though,&rdquo; added Connie, &ldquo;it is only fair that Mr. Percivale <i>should</i>
      see your work, Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will fetch my portfolio, if Mr. Percivale will promise to remember
      that I have no opinion of it. At the same time, if I could do what I
      wanted to do, I think I should not be ashamed of showing my drawings even
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now I was surprised to find how like grown women my daughters could
      talk. To me they always spoke like the children they were; but when I
      heard them now it seemed as if they had started all at once into ladies
      experienced in the ways of society. There they were chatting lightly,
      airily, and yet decidedly, a slight tone of badinage interwoven, with a
      young man of grace and dignity, whom they had only seen once before, and
      who had advanced no farther, with Connie at least, than a stately bow.
      They had, however, been a whole hour together before I arrived, and their
      mother had been with them all the while, which gives great courage to good
      girls, while, I am told, it shuts the mouths of those who are sly. But
      then it must be remembered that there are as great differences in mothers
      as in girls. And besides, I believe wise girls have an instinct about men
      that all the experience of other men cannot overtake. But yet again, there
      are many girls foolish enough to mistake a mere impulse for instinct, and
      vanity for insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Wynnie spoke, she turned and went back to the house to fetch some of
      her work. Now, had she been going a message for me, she would have gone
      like the wind; but on this occasion she stepped along in a stately manner,
      far from devoid of grace, but equally free from frolic or eagerness. And I
      could not help noting as well that Mr. Percivale&rsquo;s eyes followed her. What
      I felt or fancied is of no consequence to anybody. I do not think, even if
      I were writing an autobiography, I should be forced to tell <i>all</i>
      about myself. But an autobiography is further from my fancy, however much
      I may have trenched upon its limits, than any other form of literature
      with which I am acquainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not long in returning, however, though she came back with the same
      dignified motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing really worth either showing or concealing,&rdquo; she said to
      Mr. Percivale, as she handed him the portfolio, to help himself, as it
      were. She then turned away, as if a little feeling of shyness had come
      over her, and began to look for something to do about Connie. I could see
      that, although she had hitherto been almost indifferent about the merit of
      her drawings, she had a new-born wish that they might not appear
      altogether contemptible in the eyes of Mr. Percivale. And I saw, too, that
      Connie&rsquo;s wide eyes were taking in everything. It was wonderful how
      Connie&rsquo;s deprivations had made her keen in observing. Now she hastened to
      her sister&rsquo;s rescue even from such a slight inconvenience as the shadow of
      embarrassment in which she found herself&mdash;perhaps from having seen
      some unusual expression in my face, of which I was unconscious, though
      conscious enough of what might have occasioned such.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand, Wynnie,&rdquo; said Connie, &ldquo;and help me to move one inch
      further on my side.&mdash;I may move just that much on my side, mayn&rsquo;t I,
      papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better not, my dear, if you can do without it,&rdquo; I
      answered; for the doctor&rsquo;s injunctions had been strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, papa; but I feel as if it would do me good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turner will be here next week, you know; and you must try to stick to
      his rules till he comes to see you. Perhaps he will let you relax a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie smiled very sweetly and lay still, while Wynnie stood holding her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Mr. Percivale, having received the drawings, had walked away with
      them towards what they called the storm tower&mdash;a little building
      standing square to the points of the compass, from little windows, in
      which the coastguard could see with their telescopes along the coast on
      both sides and far out to sea. This tower stood on the very edge of the
      cliff, but behind it there was a steep descent, to reach which apparently
      he went round the tower and disappeared. He evidently wanted to make a
      leisurely examination of the drawings&mdash;somewhat formidable for
      Wynnie, I thought. At the same time, it impressed me favourably with
      regard to the young man that he was not inclined to pay a set of stupid
      and untrue compliments the instant the portfolio was opened, but, on the
      contrary, in order to speak what was real about them, would take the
      trouble to make himself in some adequate measure acquainted with them. I
      therefore, to Wynnie&rsquo;s relief, I fear, strolled after him, seeing no harm
      in taking a peep at his person, while he was taking a peep at my
      daughter&rsquo;s mind. I went round the tower to the other side, and there saw
      him at a little distance below me, but further out on a great rock that
      overhung the sea, connected with the cliff by a long narrow isthmus, a few
      yards lower than the cliff itself, only just broad enough to admit of a
      footpath along its top, and on one side going sheer down with a smooth
      hard rock-face to the sands below. The other side was less steep, and had
      some grass upon it. But the path was too narrow, and the precipice too
      steep, for me to trust my head with the business of guiding my feet along
      it. So I stood and saw him from the mainland&mdash;saw his head at least
      bent over the drawings; saw how slowly he turned from one to the other;
      saw how, after having gone over them once, he turned to the beginning and
      went over them again, even more slowly than before; saw how he turned the
      third time to the first. Then, getting tired, I went back to the group on
      the down; caught sight of Charlie and Harry turning heels over head down
      the slope toward the house; found that my wife had gone home&mdash;in
      fact, that only Connie and Wynnie were left. The sun had disappeared under
      a cloud, and the sea had turned a little slaty; the yellow flowers in the
      short down-grass no longer caught the eye with their gold, and the wind
      that bent their tops had just the suspicion of an edge in it. And Wynnie&rsquo;s
      face looked a little cloudy too, I thought, and I feared that it was my
      fault. I fancied there was just a tinge of beseeching in Connie&rsquo;s eye, as
      I looked at her, thinking there might be danger for her in the sunlessness
      of the wind. But I do not know that all this, even the clouding of the
      sun, may not have come out of my own mind, the result of my not being
      quite satisfied with myself because of the mood I had been in. My feeling
      had altered considerably in the mean time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run, Wynnie, and ask Mr. Percivale, with my compliments, to come and
      lunch with us,&rdquo; I said&mdash;more to let her see I was not displeased,
      however I might have looked, than for any other reason. She went&mdash;sedately
      as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as soon as she was gone, I saw that I had put her in a difficulty.
      For I had discovered, very soon after coming into these parts, that her
      head was no more steady than my own on high places, for she up had never
      been used to such in our own level country, except, indeed, on the stair
      that led down to the old quarry and the well, where, I can remember now,
      she always laid her hand on the balustrade with some degree of tremor,
      although she had been in the way of going up and down from childhood. But
      if she could not cross that narrow and really dangerous isthmus, still
      less could she call to a man she had never seen but once, across the
      intervening chasm. I therefore set off after her, leaving Connie lying
      there in loneliness, between the sea and the sky. But when I got to the
      other side of the little tower, instead of finding her standing hesitating
      on the brink of action, there she was on the rock beyond. Mr. Percivale
      had risen, and was evidently giving an answer to my invitation; at least,
      the next moment she turned to come back, and he followed. I stood
      trembling almost to see her cross the knife-back of that ledge. If I had
      not been almost fascinated, I should have turned and left them to come
      together, lest the evil fancy should cross her mind that I was watching
      them, for it was one thing to watch him with her drawings, and quite
      another to watch him with herself. But I stood and stared as she crossed.
      In the middle of the path, however&mdash;up to which point she had been
      walking with perfect steadiness and composure&mdash;she lifted her eyes&mdash;by
      what influence I cannot tell&mdash;saw me, looked as if she saw ghost,
      half lifted her arms, swayed as if she would fall, and, indeed, was
      falling over the precipice when Percivale, who was close behind her caught
      her in his arms, almost too late for both of them. So nearly down was she
      already, that her weight bent him over the rocky side, till it seemed as
      if he must yield, or his body snap. For he bent from the waist, and looked
      as if his feet only kept a hold on the ground. It was all over in a
      moment, but in that moment it made a sun-picture on my brain, which
      returns, ever and again, with such vivid agony that I cannot hope to get
      rid of it till I get rid of the brain itself in which lies the impress. In
      another moment they were at my side&mdash;she with a wan, terrified smile,
      he in a ruddy alarm. I was unable to speak, and could only, with trembling
      steps, lead the way from the dreadful spot. I reproached myself afterwards
      for my want of faith in God; but I had not had time to correct myself yet.
      Without a word on their side either, they followed me. Before we reached
      Connie, I recovered myself sufficiently to say, &ldquo;Not a word to Connie,&rdquo;
       and they understood me. I told Wynnie to run to the house, and send Walter
      to help me to carry Connie home. She went, and, until Walter came, I
      talked to Mr. Percivale as if nothing had happened. And what made me feel
      yet more friendly towards him was, that he did not do as some young men
      wishing to ingratiate themselves would have done: he did not offer to help
      me to carry Connie home. I saw that the offer rose in his mind, and that
      he repressed it. He understood that I must consider such a permission as a
      privilege not to be accorded to the acquaintance of a day; that I must
      know him better before I could allow the weight of my child to rest on his
      strength. I was even grateful to him for this knowledge of human nature.
      But he responded cordially to my invitation to lunch with us, and walked
      by my side as Walter and I bore the precious burden home.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our meal, he made himself quite agreeable; talked well on the
      topics of the day, not altogether as a man who had made up his mind, but
      not the less, rather the more, as a man who had thought about them, and
      one who did not find it so easy to come to a conclusion as most people do&mdash;or
      possibly as not feeling the necessity of coming to a conclusion, and
      therefore preferring to allow the conclusion to grow instead of
      constructing one for immediate use. This I rather liked than otherwise.
      His behaviour, I need hardly say, after what I have told of him already,
      was entirely that of a gentleman; and his education was good. But what I
      did not like was, that as often as the conversation made a bend in the
      direction of religious matters, he was sure to bend it away in some other
      direction as soon as ever he laid his next hold upon it. This, however,
      might have various reasons to account for it, and I would wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, as we rose from the table, he took Wynnie&rsquo;s portfolio from
      the side-table where he had laid it, and with no more than a bow and
      thanks returned it to her. She, I thought, looked a little disappointed,
      though she said as lightly as she could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you have not found anything worthy of criticism in my poor
      attempts, Mr. Percivale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I shall be most happy to tell you what I think of them
      if you would like to hear the impression they have made upon me,&rdquo; he
      replied, holding out his hand to take the portfolio again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be greatly obliged to you,&rdquo; she said, returning it, &ldquo;for I have
      had no one to help me since I left school, except a book called <i>Modern
      Painters</i>, which I think has the most beautiful things in it I ever
      read, but which I lay down every now and then with a kind of despair, as
      if I never could do anything worth doing. How long the next volume is in
      coming! Do you know the author, Mr. Percivale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I did. He has given me much help. I do not say I can agree with
      everything he writes; but when I do not, I have such a respect for him
      that I always feel as if he must be right whether he seems to me to be
      right or not. And if he is severe, it is with the severity of love that
      will speak only the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last speech fell on my ear like the tone of a church bell. &ldquo;That will
      do, my friend,&rdquo; thought I. But I said nothing to interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time he had laid the portfolio open on the side-table, and placed
      a chair in front of it for my daughter. Then seating himself by her side,
      but without the least approach to familiarity, he began to talk to her
      about her drawings, praising, in general, the feeling, but finding fault
      with the want of nicety in the execution&mdash;at least so it appeared to
      me from what I could understand of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said my daughter, &ldquo;it seems to me that if you get the feeling
      right, that is the main thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; returned Mr. Percivale; &ldquo;so much the main thing that any
      imperfection or coarseness or untruth which interferes with it becomes of
      the greatest consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can it really interfere with the feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not with most people, simply because most people observe so badly
      that their recollections of nature are all blurred and blotted and
      indistinct, and therefore the imperfections we are speaking of do not
      affect them. But with the more cultivated it is otherwise. It is for them
      you ought to work, for you do not thereby lose the others. Besides, the
      feeling is always intensified by the finish, for that belongs to the
      feeling too, and must, I should think, have some influence even where it
      is not noted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not a hopeless thing to attempt the finish of nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; to the degree, that is, in which you can represent anything
      else of nature. But in this drawing now you have no representative of,
      nothing to hint at or recall the feeling of the exquisiteness of nature&rsquo;s
      finish. Why should you not at least have drawn a true horizon-line there?
      Has the absolute truth of the meeting of sea and sky nothing to do with
      the feeling which such a landscape produces? I should have thought you
      would have learned that, if anything, from Mr. Ruskin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Percivale spoke earnestly. Wynnie, either from disappointment or
      despair, probably from a mixture of both, apparently fancied that, or
      rather felt as if, he was scolding her, and got cross. This was anything
      but dignified, especially with a stranger, and one who was doing his best
      to help her. And yet, somehow, I must with shame confess I was not
      altogether sorry to see it. In fact, my reader, I must just uncover my
      sin, and say that I felt a little jealous of Mr. Percivale. The negative
      reason was that I had not yet learned to love him. The only cure for
      jealousy is love. But I was ashamed too of Wynnie&rsquo;s behaving so
      childishly. Her face flushed, the tears came in her eyes, and she rose,
      saying, with a little choke in her voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it&rsquo;s no use trying. I won&rsquo;t intrude any more into things I am
      incapable of. I am much obliged to you, Mr. Percivale, for showing me how
      presumptuous I have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter rose as she rose, looking greatly concerned. But he did not
      attempt to answer her. Indeed she gave him no time. He could only spring
      after her to open the door for her. A more than respectful bow as she left
      the room was his only adieu. But when he turned his face again towards me,
      it expressed even a degree of consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he said, approaching me with an almost military step, much at
      variance with the shadow upon his countenance, &ldquo;I fear I have been rude to
      Miss Walton, but nothing was farther&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mistake entirely, Mr. Percivale. I heard all you were saying, and you
      were not in the least rude. On the contrary, I consider you were very kind
      to take the trouble with her you did. Allow me to make the apology for my
      daughter which I am sure she will wish made when she recovers from the
      disappointment of finding more obstacles in the way of her favourite
      pursuit than she had previously supposed. She is only too ready to lose
      heart, and she paid too little attention to your approbation and too much&mdash;in
      proportion, I mean&mdash;to your&mdash;criticism. She felt discouraged and
      lost her temper, but more with herself and her poor attempts, I venture to
      assure you, than with your remarks upon them. She is too much given to
      despising her own efforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must have been to blame if I caused any such feeling with regard to
      those drawings, for I assure you they contain great promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you think so. That I should myself be of the same opinion can
      be of no consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Walton at least sees what ought to be represented. All she needs is
      greater severity in the quality of representation. And that would have
      grown without any remark from onlookers. Only a friendly criticism is
      sometimes a great help. It opens the eyes a little sooner than they would
      have opened of themselves. And time,&rdquo; he added, with a half sigh and with
      an appeal in his tone, as if he would justify himself to my conscience,
      &ldquo;is half the battle in this world. It is over so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sooner than it ought to be,&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it may appear to you,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;for you, I presume to conjecture,
      have worked hard and done much. I may or may not have worked hard&mdash;sometimes
      I think I have, sometimes I think I have not&mdash;but I certainly have
      done little. Here I am nearly thirty, and have made no mark on the world
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that that is of so much consequence,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have never
      hoped for more than to rub out a few of the marks already made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Every man has something he can do,
      and more, I suppose, that he can&rsquo;t do. But I have no right to turn a visit
      into a visitation. Will you please tell Miss Walton that I am very sorry I
      presumed on the privileges of a drawing-master, and gave her pain. It was
      so far from my intention that it will be a lesson to me for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he took his leave, and I could not help being greatly
      pleased both with them and with his bearing. He was clearly anything but a
      common man.

      CHAPTER VI. THE SHADOW OP DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Wynnie appeared at dinner she looked ashamed of herself, and her face
      betrayed that she had been crying. But I said nothing, for I had
      confidence that all she needed was time to come to herself, that the voice
      that speaks louder than any thunder might make its stillness heard. And
      when I came home from my walk the next morning I found Mr. Percivale once
      more in the group about Connie, and evidently on the best possible terms
      with all. The same afternoon Wynnie went out sketching with Dora. I had no
      doubt that she had made some sort of apology to Mr. Percivale; but I did
      not make the slightest attempt to discover what had passed between them,
      for though it is of all things desirable that children should be quite
      open with their parents, I was most anxious to lay upon them no burden of
      obligation. For such burden lies against the door of utterance, and makes
      it the more difficult to open. It paralyses the speech of the soul. What I
      desired was that they should trust me so that faith should overcome all
      difficulty that might lie in the way of their being open with me. That end
      is not to be gained by any urging of admonition. Against such, growing
      years at least, if nothing else, will bring a strong reaction. Nor even,
      if so gained would the gain be at all of the right sort. The openness
      would not be faith. Besides, a parent must respect the spiritual person of
      his child, and approach it with reverence, for that too looks the Father
      in the face, and has an audience with him into which no earthly parent can
      enter even if he dared to desire it. Therefore I trusted my child. And
      when I saw that she looked at me a little shyly when we next met, I only
      sought to show her the more tenderness and confidence, telling her all
      about my plans with the bells, and my talks with the smith and Mrs.
      Coombes. She listened with just such interest as I had always been
      accustomed to see in her, asking such questions, and making such remarks
      as I might have expected, but I still felt that there was the thread of a
      little uneasiness through the web of our intercourse,&mdash;such a thread
      of a false colour as one may sometimes find wandering through the labour
      of the loom, and seek with pains to draw from the woven stuff. But it was
      for Wynnie to take it out, not for me. And she did not leave it long. For
      as she bade me good-night in my study, she said suddenly, yet with
      hesitating openness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I told Mr. Percivale that I was sorry I had behaved so badly about
      the drawings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did right, my child,&rdquo; I replied. At the same moment a pang of anxiety
      passed through me lest under the influence of her repentance she should
      have said anything more than becoming. But I banished the doubt instantly
      as faithlessness in the womanly instincts of my child. For we men are
      always so ready and anxious to keep women right, like the wretched
      creature, Laertes, in <i>Hamlet</i>, who reads his sister such a lesson on
      her maidenly duties, but declines almost with contempt to listen to a word
      from her as to any co-relative obligation on his side!
    </p>
    <p>
      And here I may remark in regard to one of the vexed questions of the day&mdash;the
      rights of women&mdash;that what women demand it is not for men to
      withhold. It is not their business to lay the law for women. That women
      must lay down for themselves. I confess that, although I must herein seem
      to many of my readers old-fashioned and conservative, I should not like to
      see any woman I cared much for either in parliament or in an anatomical
      class-room; but on the other hand I feel that women must be left free to
      settle that matter. If it is not good, good women will find it out and
      recoil from it. If it is good then God give them good speed. One thing
      they <i>have</i> a right to&mdash;a far wider and more valuable education
      than they have been in the way of receiving. When the mothers are well
      taught the generations will grow in knowledge at a fourfold rate. But
      still the teaching of life is better than all the schools, and common
      sense than all learning. This common sense is a rare gift, scantier in
      none than in those who lay claim to it on the ground of following
      commonplace, worldly, and prudential maxims. But I must return to my
      Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did Mr. Percivale say?&rdquo; I resumed, for she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took the blame all on himself, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a gentleman,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I could not leave it so, you know, papa, because that was not the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that I had lost my temper from disappointment; that I had
      thought I did not care for my drawings because I was so far from satisfied
      with them, but when he made me feel that they were worth nothing, then I
      found from the vexation I felt that I had cared for them. But I do think,
      papa, I was more ashamed of having shown them, and vexed with myself, than
      cross with him. But I was very silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He began to praise them then. But you know I could not take much of that,
      for what could he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might give him credit for a little honesty, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but things may be true in a way, you know, and not mean much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to have succeeded in reconciling you to the prosecution of your
      efforts, however; for I saw you go out with your sketching apparatus this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered shyly. &ldquo;He was so kind that somehow I got heart to try
      again. He&rsquo;s very nice, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My answer was not quite ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like him, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I like him&mdash;yes. But we must not be in haste with our
      judgments, you know. I have had very little opportunity of seeing into
      him. There is much in him that I like, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what? please, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth then, Wynnie, for I can speak my mind to you, my child,
      there is a certain shyness of approaching the subject of religion; so that
      I have my fears lest he should belong to any of these new schools of a
      fragmentary philosophy which acknowledge no source of truth but the
      testimony of the senses and the deductions made therefrom by the
      intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is not that a hasty conclusion, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a hasty question, my dear. I have come to no conclusion. I was
      only speaking confidentially about my fears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, papa, it&rsquo;s only that he&rsquo;s not sure enough, and is afraid of
      appearing to profess more than he believes. I&rsquo;m sure, if that&rsquo;s it, I have
      the greatest sympathy with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her, and saw the tears gathering fast in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray to God on the chance of his hearing you, my darling, and go to
      sleep,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I will not think hardly of you because you cannot be so
      sure as I am. How could you be? You have not had my experience. Perhaps
      you are right about Mr. Percivale too. But it would be an awkward thing to
      get intimate with him, you know, and then find out that we did not like
      him after all. You couldn&rsquo;t like a man much, could you, who did not
      believe in anything greater than himself, anything marvellous, grand,
      beyond our understanding&mdash;who thought that he had come out of the
      dirt and was going back to the dirt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could, papa, if he tried to do his duty notwithstanding&mdash;for I&rsquo;m
      sure I couldn&rsquo;t. I should cry myself to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my child. I should honour him too. But I should be very
      sorry for him. For he would be so disappointed in himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether this was the best answer to make, but I had little
      time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;s like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not, my dear. And more, I will not associate the idea with him till
      I know for certain. We will leave it to ignorant old ladies who lay claim
      to an instinct for theology to jump at conclusions, and reserve ours&mdash;as
      even such a man as we have been supposing might well teach us&mdash;till
      we have sufficient facts from which to draw them. Now go to bed, my
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night then, dear papa,&rdquo; she said, and left me with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was not altogether comfortable after this conversation. I had tried to
      be fair to the young man both in word and thought, but I could not relish
      the idea of my daughter falling in love with him, which looked likely
      enough, before I knew more about him, and found that <i>more</i> good and
      hope-giving. There was but one rational thing left to do, and that was to
      cast my care on him that careth for us&mdash;on the Father who loved my
      child more than even I could love her&mdash;and loved the young man too,
      and regarded my anxiety, and would take its cause upon himself. After I
      had lifted up my heart to him I was at ease, read a canto of Dante&rsquo;s <i>Paradise</i>,
      and then went to bed. The prematurity of a conversation with my wife, in
      which I found that she was very favourably impressed with Mr. Percivale,
      must be pardoned to the forecasting hearts of fathers and mothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went out for my walk the next morning, I caught sight of the sexton,
      with whom as yet I had had but little communication, busily trimming some
      of the newer graves in the churchyard. I turned in through the nearer
      gate, which was fashioned like a lych-gate, with seats on the sides and a
      stone table in the centre, but had no roof. The one on the other side of
      the church was roofed, but probably they had found that here no roof could
      resist the sea-blasts in winter. The top of the wall where the roof should
      have rested, was simply covered with flat slates to protect it from the
      rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Coombes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned up a wizened, humorous old face, the very type of a
      gravedigger&rsquo;s, and with one hand leaning on the edge of the green mound,
      upon which he had been cropping with a pair of shears the too long and too
      thin grass, touched his cap with the other, and bade me a cheerful
      good-morning in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making things tidy,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It take time to make them all comfortable, you see, sir,&rdquo; he returned,
      taking up his shears again and clipping away at the top and sides of the
      mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the dead, Coombes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; to be sure, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it makes much difference to their comfort, do you,
      whether the grass is one length or another upon their graves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well no, sir. I don&rsquo;t suppose it makes <i>much</i> difference to them.
      But it look more comfortable, you know. And I like things to look
      comfortable. Don&rsquo;t you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do, Coombes. And you are quite right. The resting-place of
      the body, although the person it belonged to be far away, should be
      respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think, though I don&rsquo;t get no credit for it. I du believe
      the people hereabouts thinks me only a single hair better than a Jack
      Ketch. But I&rsquo;m sure I du my best to make the poor things comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed unable to rid his mind of the idea that the comfort of the
      departed was dependent upon his ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble I have with them sometimes! There&rsquo;s now this same one as lies
      here, old Jonathan Giles. He have the gout so bad! and just as I come
      within a couple o&rsquo; inches o&rsquo; the right depth, out come the edge of a great
      stone in the near corner at the foot of the bed. Thinks I, he&rsquo;ll never lie
      comfortable with that same under his gouty toe. But the trouble I had to
      get out that stone! I du assure you, sir, it took me nigh half the day.&mdash;But
      this be one of the nicest places to lie in all up and down the coast&mdash;a
      nice gravelly soil, you see, sir; dry, and warm, and comfortable. Them
      poor things as comes out of the sea must quite enjoy the change, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something grotesque in the man&rsquo;s persistence in regarding the
      objects of his interest from this point of view. It was a curious way for
      the humanity that was in him to find expression; but I did not like to let
      him go on thus. It was so much opposed to all that I believed and felt
      about the change from this world to the next!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Coombes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;why will you go on talking as if it made an atom
      of difference to the dead bodies where they were buried? They care no more
      about it than your old coat would care where it was thrown after you had
      done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and regarded his coat where it hung beside him on the headstone
      of the same grave at which he was working, shook his head with a smile
      that seemed to hint a doubt whether the said old coat would be altogether
      so indifferent to its treatment when, it was past use as I had implied.
      Then he turned again to his work, and after a moment&rsquo;s silence began to
      approach me from another side. I confess he had the better of me before I
      was aware of what he was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church of Boscastle stands high on the cliff. You&rsquo;ve been to
      Boscastle, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him I had not yet, but hoped to go before the summer was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you should see Boscastle, sir. It&rsquo;s a wonderful place. That&rsquo;s where I
      was born, sir. When I was a by that church was haunted, sir. It&rsquo;s a damp
      place, and the wind in it awful. I du believe it stand higher than any
      church in the country, and have got more wind in it of a stormy night than
      any church whatsomever. Well, they said it was haunted; and sure enough
      every now and then there was a knocking heard down below. And this always
      took place of a stormy night, as if there was some poor thing down in the
      low wouts (<i>vaults</i>), and he wasn&rsquo;t comfortable and wanted to get
      out. Well, one night it was so plain and so fearful it was that the sexton
      he went and took the blacksmith and a ship&rsquo;s carpenter down to the
      harbour, and they go up together, and they hearken all over the floor, and
      they open one of the old family wouts that belongs to the Penhaligans, and
      they go down with a light. Now the wind it was a-blowing all as usual,
      only worse than common. And there to be sure what do they see but the wout
      half-full of sea-water, and nows and thens a great spout coming in through
      a hole in the rock; for it was high-water and a wind off the sea, as I
      tell you. And there was a coffin afloat on the water, and every time the
      spout come through, it set it knocking agen the side o&rsquo; the wout, and that
      was the ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a horrible idea!&rdquo; I said, with a half-shudder at the unrest of the
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man uttered a queer long-drawn sound,&mdash;neither a chuckle, a
      crow, nor a laugh, but a mixture of all three,&mdash;and turned himself
      yet again to the work which, as he approached the end of his narration, he
      had suspended, that he might make his story <i>tell</i>, I suppose, by
      looking me in the face. And as he turned he said, &ldquo;I thought you would
      like to be comfortable then as well as other people, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help laughing to see how the cunning old fellow had caught me.
      I have not yet been able to find out how much of truth there was in his
      story. From the twinkle of his eye I cannot help suspecting that if he did
      not invent the tale, he embellished it, at least, in order to produce the
      effect which he certainly did produce. Humour was clearly his predominant
      disposition, the reflex of which was to be seen, after a mild lunar
      fashion, on the countenance of his wife. Neither could I help thinking
      with pleasure, as I turned away, how the merry little old man would enjoy
      telling his companions how he had posed the new parson. Very welcome was
      he to his laugh for my part. Yet I gladly left the churchyard, with its
      sunshine above and its darkness below. Indeed I had to look up to the
      glittering vanes on the four pinnacles of the church-tower, dwelling aloft
      in the clean sunny air, to get the feeling of the dark vault, and the
      floating coffin, and the knocking heard in the windy church, out of my
      brain. But the thing that did free me was the reflection with what supreme
      disregard the disincarcerated spirit would look upon any possible
      vicissitudes of its abandoned vault. For in proportion as the body of
      man&rsquo;s revelation ceases to be in harmony with the spirit that dwells
      therein, it becomes a vault, a prison, from which it must be freedom to
      escape at length. The house we like best would be a prison of awful sort
      if doors and windows were built up. Man&rsquo;s abode, as age begins to draw
      nigh, fares thus. Age is in fact the mason that builds up the doors and
      the windows, and death is the angel that breaks the prison-house and lets
      the captives free. Thus I got something out of the sexton&rsquo;s horrible
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the week was over, death came near indeed&mdash;in far other
      fashion than any funereal tale could have brought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after lunch, I had retired to my study, and was dozing in my
      chair, for the day was hot, when I was waked by Charlie rushing into the
      room with the cry, &ldquo;Papa, papa, there&rsquo;s a man drowning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started up, and hurried down to the drawing-room, which looked out over
      the bay. I could see nothing but people running about on the edge of the
      quiet waves. No sign of human being was on&mdash;the water. But the one
      boat belonging to the pilot was coming out from the shelter of the lock of
      the canal where it usually lay, and my friend of the coastguard was
      running down from the tower on the cliff with ropes in his hand. He would
      not stop the boat even for the moment it would need to take him on board,
      but threw them in and urged to haste. I stood at the window and watched.
      Every now and then I fancied I saw something white heaved up on the swell
      of a wave, and as often was satisfied that I had but fancied it. The boat
      seemed to be floating about lazily, if not idly. The eagerness to help
      made it appear as if nothing was going on. Could it, after all, have been
      a false alarm? Was there, after all, no insensible form swinging about in
      the sweep of those waves, with life gradually oozing away? Long, long as
      it seemed to me, I watched, and still the boat kept moving from place to
      place, so far out that I could see nothing distinctly of the motions of
      its crew. At length I saw something. Yes; a long white thing rose from the
      water slowly, and was drawn into the boat. It rowed swiftly to the shore.
      There was but one place fit to land upon,&mdash;a little patch of sand,
      nearly covered at high-water, but now lying yellow in the sun, under the
      window at which I stood, and immediately under our garden-wall. Thither
      the boat shot along; and there my friend of the coastguard, earnest and
      sad, was waiting to use, though without hope, every appliance so well
      known to him from the frequent occurrence of such necessity in the course
      of his watchful duties along miles and miles of stormy coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not linger over the sad details of vain endeavour. The honoured
      head of a family, he had departed and left a good name behind him. But
      even in the midst of my poor attentions to the quiet, speechless,
      pale-faced wife, who sat at the head of the corpse, I could not help
      feeling anxious about the effect on my Connie. It was impossible to keep
      the matter concealed from her. The undoubted concern on the faces of the
      two boys was enough to reveal that something serious and painful had
      occurred; while my wife and Wynnie, and indeed the whole household, were
      busy in attending to every remotest suggestion of aid that reached them
      from the little crowd gathered about the body. At length it was concluded,
      on the verdict of the medical man who had been sent for, that all further
      effort was useless. The body was borne away, and I led the poor lady to
      her lodging, and remained there with her till I found that, as she lay on
      the sofa, the sleep that so often dogs the steps of sorrow had at length
      thrown its veil over her consciousness, and put her for the time to rest.
      There is a gentle consolation in the firmness of the grasp of the
      inevitable, known but to those who are led through the valley of the
      shadow. I left her with her son and daughter, and returned to my own
      family. They too were of course in the skirts of the cloud. Had they only
      heard of the occurrence, it would have had little effect; but death had
      appeared to them. Everyone but Connie had seen the dead lying there; and
      before the day was over, I wished that she too had seen the dead. For I
      found from what she said at intervals, and from the shudder that now and
      then passed through her, that her imagination was at work, showing but the
      horrors that belong to death; for the enfolding peace that accompanies it
      can be known but by sight of the dead. When I spoke to her, she seemed,
      and I suppose for the time felt tolerably quiet and comfortable; but I
      could see that the words she had heard fall in the going and coming, and
      the communications of Charlie and Harry to each other, had made as it were
      an excoriation on her fancy, to which her consciousness was ever
      returning. And now I became more grateful than I had yet been for the gift
      of that gipsy-child. For I felt no anxiety about Connie so long as she was
      with her. The presence even of her mother could not relieve her, for she
      and Wynnie were both clouded with the same awe, and its reflex in Connie
      was distorted by her fancy. But the sweet ignorance of the baby, which
      rightly considered is more than a type or symbol of faith, operated most
      healingly; for she appeared in her sweet merry ways&mdash;no baby was ever
      more filled with the mere gladness of life than Connie&rsquo;s baby&mdash;to the
      mood in which they all were, like a little sunny window in a cathedral
      crypt, telling of a whole universe of sunshine and motion beyond those
      oppressed pillars and low-groined arches. And why should not the baby know
      best? I believe the babies do know best. I therefore favoured her having
      the child more than I might otherwise have thought good for her, being
      anxious to get the dreary, unhealthy impression healed as soon as
      possible, lest it should, in the delicate physical condition in which she
      was, turn to a sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my wife suffered for a time nearly as much as Connie. As long as she
      was going about the house or attending to the wants of her family, she was
      free; but no sooner did she lay her head on the pillow than in rushed the
      cry of the sea, fierce, unkind, craving like a wild beast. Again and again
      she spoke of it to me, for it came to her mingled with the voice of the
      tempter, saying, &ldquo;<i>Cruel chance</i>,&rdquo; over and over again. For although
      the two words contradict each other when put together thus, each in its
      turn would assert itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great part of the doubt in the world comes from the fact that there are
      in it so many more of the impressible as compared with the originating
      minds. Where the openness to impression is balanced by the power of
      production, the painful questions of the world are speedily met by their
      answers; where such is not the case, there are often long periods of
      suffering till the child-answer of truth is brought to the birth. Hence
      the need for every impressible mind to be, by reading or speech, held in
      living association with an original mind able to combat those suggestions
      of doubt and even unbelief, which the look of things must often occasion&mdash;a
      look which comes from our inability to gain other than fragmentary visions
      of the work that the Father worketh hitherto. When the kingdom of heaven
      is at hand, one sign thereof will be that all clergymen will be more or
      less of the latter sort, and mere receptive goodness, no more than
      education and moral character, will be considered sufficient reason for a
      man&rsquo;s occupying the high position of an instructor of his fellows. But
      even now this possession of original power is not by any means to be
      limited to those who make public show of the same. In many a humble parish
      priest it shows itself at the bedside of the suffering, or in the
      admonition of the closet, although as yet there are many of the clergy
      who, so far from being able to console wisely, are incapable of
      understanding the condition of those that need consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all a fancy, my dear,&rdquo; I said to her. &ldquo;There is nothing more
      terrible in this than in any other death. On the contrary, I can hardly
      imagine a less fearful one. A big wave falls on the man&rsquo;s head and stuns
      him, and without further suffering he floats gently out on the sea of the
      unknown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so terrible for those left behind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you seen the face of his widow, so gentle, so loving, so resigned in
      its pallor, you would not have thought it so <i>terrible</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But though she always seemed satisfied, and no doubt felt nearly so, after
      any conversation of the sort, yet every night she would call out once and
      again, &ldquo;O, that sea, out there!&rdquo; I was very glad indeed when Mr. Turner,
      who had arranged to spend a short holiday with us, arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was concerned at the news I gave him of the shock both Connie and her
      mother had received, and counselled an immediate change, that time might,
      in the absence of surrounding associations, obliterate something of the
      impression that had been made. The consequence was, that we resolved to
      remove our household, for a short time, to some place not too far off to
      permit of my attending to my duties at Kilkhaven, but out of the sight and
      sound of the sea. It was Thursday when Mr. Turner arrived, and he spent
      the next two days in inquiring and looking about for a suitable spot to
      which we might repair as early in the week as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday the blacksmith was busy in the church-tower, and I went in
      to see how he was getting on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a sad business here the last week, sir,&rdquo; he said, after we had
      done talking about the repairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very sad business indeed,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a warning to us all,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may well take it so,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;But it seems to me that we are too
      ready to think of such remarkable things only by themselves, instead of
      being roused by them to regard everything, common and uncommon, as ordered
      by the same care and wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of our local preachers made a grand use of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no reply. He resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me you took no notice of it last Sunday, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made no immediate allusion to it, certainly. But I preached under the
      influence of it. And I thought it better that those who could reflect on
      the matter should be thus led to think for themselves than that they
      should be subjected to the reception of my thoughts and feelings about it;
      for in the main it is life and not death that we have to preach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand you, sir. But then you don&rsquo;t care much for
      preaching in your church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;that there has been much indifference on that
      point. I could, however, mention to you many and grand exceptions. Still
      there is, even in some of the best in the church, a great amount of
      disbelief in the efficacy of preaching. And I allow that a great deal of
      what is called preaching, partakes of its nature only in the remotest
      degree. But, while I hold a strong opinion of its value&mdash;that is,
      where it is genuine&mdash;I venture just to suggest that the nature of the
      preaching to which the body you belong to has resorted, has had something
      to do, by way of a reaction, in driving the church to the other extreme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You try to work upon people&rsquo;s feelings without reference to their
      judgment. Anyone who can preach what you call rousing sermons is
      considered a grand preacher amongst you, and there is a great danger of
      his being led thereby to talk more nonsense than sense. And then when the
      excitement goes off, there is no seed left in the soil to grow in peace,
      and they are always craving after more excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is the preacher to rouse them up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the consequence is that they continue like children&mdash;the good
      ones, I mean&mdash;and have hardly a chance of making a calm, deliberate
      choice of that which is good; while those who have been only excited and
      nothing more, are hardened and seared by the recurrence of such feeling as
      is neither aroused by truth nor followed by action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You daren&rsquo;t talk like that if you knew the kind of people in this country
      that the Methodists, as you call them, have got a hold of. They tell me it
      was like hell itself down in those mines before Wesley come among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be a fool or a bigot to doubt that the Wesleyans have done
      incalculable good in the country. And that not alone to the people who
      never went to church. The whole Church of England is under obligations to
      Methodism such as no words can overstate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you can say such things against them, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there you show the evil of thinking too much about the party you
      belong to. It makes a man touchy; and then he fancies when another is
      merely, it may be, analysing a difference, or insisting strongly on some
      great truth, that he is talking against his party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said, sir, that our clergy don&rsquo;t care about moving our judgments,
      only our feelings. Now I know preachers amongst us of whom that would be
      anything but true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there must be. But there is what I say&mdash;your party-feeling
      makes you touchy. A man can&rsquo;t always be saying in the press of utterance,
      &lsquo;<i>Of course there are exceptions</i>.&rsquo; That is understood. I confess I
      do not know much about your clergy, for I have not had the opportunity.
      But I do know this, that some of the best and most liberal people I have
      ever known have belonged to your community.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do gather a deal of money for good purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But that was not what I meant by <i>liberal</i>. It is far easier to
      give money than to be generous in judgment. I meant by <i>liberal</i>,
      able to see the good and true in people that differ from you&mdash;glad to
      be roused to the reception of truth in God&rsquo;s name from whatever quarter it
      may come, and not readily finding offence where a remark may have chanced
      to be too sweeping or unguarded. But I see that I ought to be more
      careful, for I have made you, who certainly are not one of the quarrelsome
      people I have been speaking of, misunderstand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir. I was hasty. But I do think I am more ready to
      lose my temper since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he stopped. A fit of coughing came on, and, to my concern, was
      followed by what I saw plainly could be the result only of a rupture in
      the lungs. I insisted on his dropping his work and coming home with me,
      where I made him rest the remainder of the day and all Sunday, sending
      word to his mother that I could not let him go home. When we left on the
      Monday morning, we took him with us in the carriage hired for the journey,
      and set him down at his mother&rsquo;s, apparently no worse than usual.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. AT THE FARM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leaving the younger members of the family at home with the servants, we
      set out for a farmhouse, some twenty miles off, which Turner had
      discovered for us. Connie had stood the journey down so well, and was now
      so much stronger, that we had no anxiety about her so far as regarded the
      travelling. Through deep lanes with many cottages, and here and there a
      very ugly little chapel, over steep hills, up which Turner and Wynnie and
      I walked, and along sterile moors we drove, stopping at roadside inns, and
      often besides to raise Connie and let her look about upon the extended
      prospect, so that it was drawing towards evening before we arrived at our
      destination. On the way Turner had warned us that we were not to expect a
      beautiful country, although the place was within reach of much that was
      remarkable. Therefore we were not surprised when we drew up at the door of
      a bare-looking, shelterless house, with scarcely a tree in sight, and a
      stretch of undulating fields on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dreary place in winter, Turner,&rdquo; I said, after we had seen Connie
      comfortably deposited in the nice white-curtained parlour, smelling of
      dried roses even in the height of the fresh ones, and had strolled out
      while our tea&mdash;dinner was being got ready for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a doubt of it; but just the place I wanted for Miss Connie,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;We are high above the sea, and the air is very bracing, and not,
      at this season, too cold. A month later I should not on any account have
      brought her here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think even now there is a certain freshness in the wind that calls up a
      kind of will in the nerves to meet it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what I wanted for you all. You observe there is no rasp
      in its touch, however. There are regions in this island of ours where even
      in the hottest day in summer you would frequently discover a certain
      unfriendly edge in the air, that would set you wondering whether the
      seasons had not changed since you were a boy, and used to lie on the grass
      half the idle day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I often do wonder whether it may not be so, but I always come to the
      conclusion that even this is but an example of the involuntary tendency of
      the mind of man towards the ideal. He forgets all that comes between and
      divides the hints of perfection scattered here and there along the scope
      of his experience. I especially remember one summer day in my childhood,
      which has coloured all my ideas of summer and bliss and fulfilment of
      content. It is made up of only mossy grass, and the scent of the earth and
      wild flowers, and hot sun, and perfect sky&mdash;deep and blue, and
      traversed by blinding white clouds. I could not have been more than five
      or six, I think, from the kind of dress I wore, the very pearl buttons of
      which, encircled on their face with a ring of half-spherical hollows, have
      their undeniable relation in my memory to the heavens and the earth, to
      the march of the glorious clouds, and the tender scent of the rooted
      flowers; and, indeed, when I think of it, must, by the delight they gave
      me, have opened my mind the more to the enjoyment of the eternal paradise
      around me. What a thing it is to please a child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean perfectly,&rdquo; answered Turner. &ldquo;It is as I get older
      that I understand what Wordsworth says about childhood. It is indeed a
      mercy that we were not born grown men, with what we consider our wits
      about us. They are blinding things those wits we gather. I fancy that the
      single thread by which God sometimes keeps hold of a man is such an
      impression of his childhood as that of which you have been speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt it; for conscience is so near in all those memories to
      which you refer. The whole surrounding of them is so at variance with sin!
      A sense of purity, not in himself, for the child is not feeling that he is
      pure, is all about him; and when afterwards the condition returns upon
      him,&mdash;returns when he is conscious of so much that is evil and so
      much that is unsatisfied in him,&mdash;it brings with it a longing after
      the high clear air of moral well-being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, then, that it is only by association that nature thus
      impresses us? that she has no power of meaning these things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. No doubt there is something in the recollection of the
      associations of childhood to strengthen the power of nature upon us; but
      the power is in nature herself, else it would be but a poor weak thing to
      what it is. There <i>is</i> purity and state in that sky. There <i>is</i>
      a peace now in this wide still earth&mdash;not so very beautiful, you own&mdash;and
      in that overhanging blue, which my heart cries out that it needs and
      cannot be well till it gains&mdash;gains in the truth, gains in God, who
      is the power of truth, the living and causing truth. There is indeed a
      rest that remaineth, a rest pictured out even here this night, to rouse my
      dull heart to desire it and follow after it, a rest that consists in
      thinking the thoughts of Him who is the Peace because the Unity, in being
      filled with that spirit which now pictures itself forth in this repose of
      the heavens and the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Turner, after a pause. &ldquo;I must think more about such things.
      The science the present day is going wild about will not give us that
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but that rest will do much to give you that science. A man with this
      repose in his heart will do more by far, other capabilities being equal,
      to find out the laws that govern things. For all law is living rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you have been saying,&rdquo; resumed Turner, after another pause, &ldquo;reminds
      me much of one of Wordsworth&rsquo;s poems. I do not mean the famous ode.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the &lsquo;Ninth Evening Voluntary,&rsquo; I know&mdash;one of his finest
      and truest and deepest poems. It begins, &lsquo;Had this effulgence
      disappeared.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the one I mean. I shall read it again when I go home. But
      you don&rsquo;t agree with Wordsworth, do you, about our having had an existence
      previous to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a little laugh as he asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. But an opinion held by such men as Plato, Origen, and
      Wordsworth, is not to be laughed at, Mr. Turner. It cannot be in its
      nature absurd. I might have mentioned Shelley as holding it, too, had his
      opinion been worth anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think much of Shelley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think his <i>feeling</i> most valuable; his <i>opinion</i> nearly
      worthless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps I had no business to laugh, at it; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not suppose for a moment that I even lean to it. I dislike it. It
      would make me unhappy to think there was the least of sound argument for
      it. But I respect the men who have held it, and know there must be <i>something</i>
      good in it, else they could not have held it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you able then to sympathise with that ode of Wordsworth&rsquo;s? Does it
      not depend for all its worth on the admission of this theory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. Is it necessary to admit that we must have had a
      conscious life before this life to find meaning in the words,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;But trailing clouds of glory do we come
  From God who is our home&rsquo;?
</pre>
    <p>
      Is not all the good in us his image? Imperfect and sinful as we are, is
      not all the foundation of our being his image? Is not the sin all ours,
      and the life in us all God&rsquo;s? We cannot be the creatures of God without
      partaking of his nature. Every motion of our conscience, every admiration
      of what is pure and noble, is a sign and a result of this. Is not every
      self-accusation a proof of the presence of his spirit? That comes not of
      ourselves&mdash;that is not without him. These are the clouds of glory we
      come trailing from him. All feelings of beauty and peace and loveliness
      and right and goodness, we trail with us from our home. God is the only
      home of the human soul. To interpret in this manner what Wordsworth says,
      will enable us to enter into perfect sympathy with all that grandest of
      his poems. I do not say this is what he meant; but I think it includes
      what he meant by being greater and wider than what he meant. Nor am I
      guilty of presumption in saying so, for surely the idea that we are born
      of God is a greater idea than that we have lived with him a life before
      this life. But Wordsworth is not the first among our religious poets to
      give us at least what is valuable in the notion. I came upon a volume
      amongst my friend Shepherd&rsquo;s books, with which I had made no acquaintance
      before&mdash;Henry Vaughan&rsquo;s poems. I brought it with me, for it has finer
      lines, I almost think, than any in George Herbert, though not so fine
      poems by any means as his best. When we go into the house I will read one
      of them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Turner. &ldquo;I wish I could have such talk once a week. The
      shades of the prison-house, you know, Mr. Walton, are always trying to
      close about us, and shut out the vision of the glories we have come from,
      as Wordsworth says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;who ministers to the miserable necessities of his
      fellows has even more need than another to believe in the light and the
      gladness&mdash;else a poor Job&rsquo;s comforter will he be. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want
      to be treated like a musical snuff-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man can <i>prove</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there is not a being inside the
      snuff-box, existing in virtue of the harmony of its parts, comfortable
      when they go well, sick when they go badly, and dying when it is
      dismembered, or even when it stops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;No man can prove it. But no man can convince a human
      being of it. And just as little can anyone convince me that my conscience,
      making me do sometimes what I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> like, comes from a harmonious
      action of the particles of my brain. But it is time we went in, for by the
      law of things in general, I being ready for my dinner, my dinner ought to
      be ready for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A law with more exceptions than instances, I fear,&rdquo; said Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt that,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;The readiness is everything, and that we
      constantly blunder in. But we had better see whether we are really ready
      for it, by trying whether it is ready for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie went to bed early, as indeed we all did, and she was rather better
      than worse the next morning. My wife, for the first time for many nights,
      said nothing about the crying of the sea. The following day Turner and I
      set out to explore the neighbourhood. The rest remained quietly at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, as I have said, a high bare country. The fields lay side by side,
      parted from each other chiefly, as so often in Scotland, by stone walls;
      and these stones being of a laminated nature, the walls were not
      unfrequently built by laying thin plates on their edges, which gave a
      neatness to them not found in other parts of the country as far as I am
      aware. In the middle of the fields came here and there patches of yet
      unreclaimed moorland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in a region like this, beauty must be looked for below the surface.
      There is a probability of finding hollows of repose, sunken spots of
      loveliness, hidden away altogether from the general aspect of sternness,
      or perhaps sterility, that meets the eye in glancing over the outspread
      landscape; just as in the natures of stern men you may expect to find, if
      opportunity should be afforded you, sunny spots of tender verdure, kept
      ever green by that very sternness which is turned towards the common gaze&mdash;thus
      existent because they are below the surface, and not laid bare to the
      sweep of the cold winds that roam the world. How often have not men
      started with amaze at the discovery of some feminine sweetness, some grace
      of protection in the man whom they had judged cold and hard and rugged,
      inaccessible to the more genial influences of humanity! It may be that
      such men are only fighting against the wind, and keep their hearts open to
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew this; and when Turner and I set out that morning to explore, I
      expected to light upon some instance of it&mdash;some mine or other in
      which nature had hidden away rare jewels; but I was not prepared to find
      such as I did find. With our hearts full of a glad secret we returned
      home, but we said nothing about it, in order that Ethelwyn and Wynnie
      might enjoy the discovery even as we had enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another grand fact with regard to the neighbourhood about which
      we judged it better to be silent for a few days, that the inland
      influences might be free to work. We were considerably nearer the ocean
      than my wife and daughters supposed, for we had made a great round in
      order to arrive from the land-side. We were, however, out of the sound of
      its waves, which broke all along the shore, in this part, at the foot of
      tremendous cliffs. What cliffs they were we shall soon find.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE KEEVE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear! now, Wynnie!&rdquo; I said, after prayers the next morning, &ldquo;you
      must come out for a walk as soon as ever you can get your bonnets on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t leave Connie, papa,&rdquo; objected Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, you can, quite well. There&rsquo;s nursie to look after her. What do
      you say, Connie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For, for some time now, Connie had been able to get up so early, that it
      was no unusual thing to have prayers in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am entirely independent of help from my family,&rdquo; returned Connie
      grandiloquently. &ldquo;I am a woman of independent means,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;If you
      say another word, I will rise and leave the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she made a movement as if she would actually do as she had said.
      Seized with an involuntary terror, I rushed towards her, and the
      impertinent girl burst out laughing in my face&mdash;threw herself back on
      her pillows, and laughed delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, papa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I carry a terrible club for rebellious
      people.&rdquo; Then, her mood changing, she added, as if to suppress the tears
      gathering in her eyes, &ldquo;I am the queen&mdash;of luxury and self-will&mdash;and
      I won&rsquo;t have anybody come near me till dinner-time. I mean to enjoy
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the matter was settled, and we went out for our walk. Ethelwyn was not
      such a good walker as she had been; but even if she had retained the
      strength of her youth, we should not have got on much the better for it&mdash;so
      often did she and Wynnie stop to grub ferns out of the chinks and roots of
      the stone-walls. Now, I admire ferns as much as anybody&mdash;that is,
      not, I fear, so much as my wife and daughter, but quite enough
      notwithstanding&mdash;but I do not quite enjoy being pulled up like a fern
      at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear, what is the use of stopping to torture that harmless
      vegetable?&rdquo; I say, but say in vain. &ldquo;It is much more beautiful where it is
      than it will be anywhere where you can put it. Besides, you know they
      never come to anything with you. They <i>always</i> die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon my wife reminds me of this fern and that fern, gathered in such
      and such places, and now in such and such corners of the garden or the
      greenhouse, or under glass-shades in this or that room, of the very
      existence of which I am ignorant, whether from original inattention, or
      merely from forgetfulness, I do not know. Certainly, out of their own
      place I do not care much for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, partly by the inducement I held out to them of a much greater
      variety of ferns where we were bound, I succeeded in getting them over the
      two miles in little more than two hours. After passing from the lanes into
      the fields, our way led downwards till we reached a very steep large
      slope, with a delightful southern exposure, and covered with the sweetest
      down-grasses. It was just the place to lie in, as on the edge of the
      earth, and look abroad upon the universe of air and floating worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us have a rest here, Ethel,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am sure this is much more
      delightful than uprooting ferns. What an awful thing to think that here we
      are on this great round tumbling ball of a world, held by the feet, and
      lifting up the head into infinite space&mdash;without choice or wish of
      our own&mdash;compelled to think and to be, whether we will or not! Just
      God must know it to be very good, or he would not have taken it in his
      hands to make individual lives without a possible will of theirs. He must
      be our Father, or we are wretched creatures&mdash;the slaves of a fatal
      necessity! Did it ever strike you, Turner, that each one of us stands on
      the apex of the world? With a sphere, you know, it must be so. And thus is
      typified, as it seems to me, that each one of us must look up for himself
      to find God, and then look abroad to find his fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; was all Turner&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;the apprehension of this truth has, in otherwise
      ill-ordered minds, given rise to all sorts of fierce and grotesque
      fanaticism. But the minds which have thus conceived the truth, would have
      been immeasurably worse without it; nay, this truth affords at last the
      only possible door out of the miseries of their own chaos, whether
      inherited or the result of their own misconduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in the grass?&rdquo; cried Wynnie, in a tone of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked where she indicated, and saw a slow-worm, or blind-worm, lying
      basking in the sun. I rose and went towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your stick,&rdquo; said Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Why should I kill it? It is perfectly harmless, and,
      to my mind, beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took it in my hands, and brought it to my wife. She gave an involuntary
      shudder as it came near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you it is harmless,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;though it has a forked tongue.&rdquo;
       And I opened its mouth as I spoke. &ldquo;I do not think the serpent form is
      essentially ugly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes me feel ugly,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allow I do not quite understand the mystery of it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But you
      never saw lovelier ornamentation than these silvery scales, with all the
      neatness of what you ladies call a set pattern, and none of the stiffness,
      for there are not two of them the same in form. And you never saw lovelier
      curves than this little patient creature, which does not even try to get
      away from me, makes with the queer long thin body of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how it can look after its tail, it is so far off,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does though&mdash;better than you ladies look after your long dresses.
      I wonder whether it is descended from creatures that once had feet, and
      did not make a good use of them. Perhaps they had wings even, and would
      not use them at all, and so lost them. Its ancestors may have had
      poison-fangs; it is innocent enough. But it is a terrible thing to be all
      feet, is it not? There is an awful significance in the condemnation of the
      serpent&mdash;&lsquo;On thy belly shalt thou go, and eat dust.&rsquo; But it is better
      to talk of beautiful things. <i>My</i> soul at least has dropped from its
      world apex. Let us go on. Come, wife. Come, Turner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not seem willing to rise. But the glen drew me. I rose, and my
      wife followed my example with the help of my hand. She returned to the
      subject, however, as we descended the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that in the course of ever so many ages wings and feet
      should be both lost?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most presumptuous thing in the world is to pronounce on the possible
      and the impossible. I do not know what is possible and what is impossible.
      I can only tell a little of what is true and what is untrue. But I do say
      this, that between the condition of many decent members of society and
      that for the sake of which God made them, there is a gulf quite as vast as
      that between a serpent and a bird. I get peeps now and then into the
      condition of my own heart, which, for the moment, make it seem impossible
      that I should ever rise into a true state of nature&mdash;that is, into
      the simplicity of God&rsquo;s will concerning me. The only hope for ourselves
      and for others lies in him&mdash;in the power the creating spirit has over
      the spirits he has made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the descent on the grass was getting too steep and slippery
      to admit of our continuing to advance in that direction. We turned,
      therefore, down the valley in the direction of the sea. It was but a
      narrow cleft, and narrowed much towards a deeper cleft, in which we now
      saw the tops of trees, and from which we heard the rush of water. Nor had
      we gone far in this direction before we came upon a gate in a stone wall,
      which led into what seemed a neglected garden. We entered, and found a
      path turning and winding, among small trees, and luxuriant ferns, and
      great stones, and fragments of ruins down towards the bottom of the chasm.
      The noise of falling water increased as we went on, and at length, after
      some scrambling and several sharp turns, we found ourselves with a nearly
      precipitous wall on each side, clothed with shrubs and ivy, and creeping
      things of the vegetable world. Up this cleft there was no advance. The
      head of it was a precipice down which shot the stream from the vale above,
      pouring out of a deep slit it had itself cut in the rock as with a knife.
      Halfway down, it tumbled into a great basin of hollowed stone, and flowing
      from a chasm in its side, which left part of the lip of the basin standing
      like the arch of a vanished bridge, it fell into a black pool below,
      whence it crept as if half-stunned or weary down the gentle decline of the
      ravine. It was a perfect little picture. I, for my part, had never seen
      such a picturesque fall. It was a little gem of nature, complete in
      effect. The ladies were full of pleasure. Wynnie, forgetting her usual
      reserve, broke out in frantic exclamations of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood for a while regarding the ceaseless pour of the water down the
      precipice, here shot slanting in a little trough of the rock, full of
      force and purpose, here falling in great curls of green and gray, with an
      expression of absolute helplessness and conscious perdition, as if sheer
      to the centre, but rejoicing the next moment to find itself brought up
      boiling and bubbling in the basin, to issue in the gathered hope of
      experience. Then we turned down the stream a little way, crossed it by a
      plank, and stood again to regard it from the opposite side. Small as the
      whole affair was&mdash;not more than about a hundred and fifty feet in
      height&mdash;it was so full of variety that I saw it was all my memory
      could do, if it carried away anything like a correct picture of its
      aspect. I was contemplating it fixedly, when a little stifled cry from
      Wynnie made me start and look round. Her face was flushed, yet she was
      trying to look unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we were quite alone, papa,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I see a gentleman
      sketching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked whither she indicated. A little way down, the bed of the ravine
      widened considerably, and was no doubt filled with water in rainy weather.
      Now it was swampy&mdash;full of reeds and willow bushes. But on the
      opposite side of the stream, with a little canal from it going all around
      it, lay a great flat rectangular stone, not more than a foot above the
      level of the water, and upon a camp-stool in the centre of this stone sat
      a gentleman sketching. I had no doubt that Wynnie had recognised him at
      once. And I was annoyed, and indeed angry, to think that Mr. Percivale had
      followed us here. But while I regarded him, he looked up, rose very
      quietly, and, with his pencil in his hand, came towards us. With no nearer
      approach to familiarity than a bow, and no expression of either much
      pleasure or any surprise, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen your party for some time, Mr. Walton&mdash;since you crossed
      the stream; but I would not break in upon your enjoyment with the surprise
      which my presence here must cause you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I answered with a bow of some sort; for I could not say with
      truth that I was glad to see him. He resumed, doubtless penetrating my
      suspicion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been here almost a week. I certainly had no expectation of the
      pleasure of seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he said lightly, though no doubt with the object of clearing himself.
      And I was, if not reassured, yet disarmed, by his statement; for I could
      not believe, from what I knew of him, that he would be guilty of such a
      white lie as many a gentleman would have thought justifiable on the
      occasion. Still, I suppose he found me a little stiff, for presently he
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will excuse me, I will return to my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I felt as if I must say something, for I had shown him no courtesy
      during the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a great pleasure to carry away such talismans with you&mdash;capable
      of bringing the place back to your mental vision at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am a little ashamed of being found
      sketching here. Such bits of scenery are not of my favourite studies. But
      it is a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very beautiful here,&rdquo; I said, in a tone of contravention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very pretty,&rdquo; he answered&mdash;&ldquo;very lovely, if you will&mdash;not
      very beautiful, I think. I would keep that word for things of larger
      regard. Beauty requires width, and here is none. I had almost said this
      place was fanciful&mdash;the work of imagination in her play-hours, not in
      her large serious moods. It affects me like the face of a woman only
      pretty, about which boys and guardsmen will rave&mdash;to me not very
      interesting, save for its single lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, do you sketch the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very fair question,&rdquo; he returned, with a smile. &ldquo;Just because it is
      soothing from the very absence of beauty. I would far rather, however, if
      I were only following my taste, take the barest bit of the moor above,
      with a streak of the cold sky over it. That gives room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would like to put a skylark in it, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I would if I knew how. I see you know what I mean. But the mere
      romantic I never had much taste for; though if you saw the kind of
      pictures I try to paint, you would not wonder that I take sketches of
      places like this, while in my heart of hearts I do not care much for them.
      They are so different, and just <i>therefore</i> they are good for me. I
      am not working now; I am only playing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a view to working better afterwards, I have no doubt,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right there, I hope,&rdquo; was his quiet reply, as he turned and
      walked back to the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not made a step towards joining us. He had only taken his hat off
      to the ladies. He was gaining ground upon me rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you quarrelled with our new friend, Harry?&rdquo; said my wife, as I came
      up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting on a stone. Turner and Wynnie were farther off towards the
      foot of the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; I answered, slightly outraged&mdash;I did not at first
      know why&mdash;by the question. &ldquo;He is only gone to his work, which is a
      duty belonging both to the first and second tables of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you have asked him to come home to our early dinner, then,&rdquo; she
      rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not. That remains for you to do. Come, I will take you to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethelwyn rose at once, put her hand in mine, and with a little help soon
      reached the table-rock. When Percivale saw that she was really on a visit
      to him on his island-perch, he rose, and when she came near enough, held
      out his hand. It was but a step, and she was beside him in a moment. After
      the usual greetings, which on her part, although very quiet, like every
      motion and word of hers, were yet indubitably cordial and kind, she said,
      &ldquo;When you get back to London, Mr. Percivale, might I ask you to allow some
      friends of mine to call at your studio, and see your paintings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; answered Percivale. &ldquo;I must warn you, however, that I
      have not much they will care to see. They will perhaps go away less happy
      than they entered. Not many people care to see my pictures twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not send you anyone I thought unworthy of the honour,&rdquo; answered
      my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percivale bowed&mdash;one of his stately, old-world bows, which I greatly
      liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any friend of yours&mdash;that is guarantee sufficient,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was this peculiarity about any compliment that Percivale paid, that
      you had not a doubt of its being genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come and take an early dinner with us?&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;My
      invalid daughter will be very pleased to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will with pleasure,&rdquo; he answered, but in a tone of some hesitation, as
      he glanced from Ethelwyn to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife speaks for us all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It will give us all pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only afraid it will break in upon your morning&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; remarked
      Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, that is not of the least consequence,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;In fact, as I
      have just been saying to Mr. Walton, I am not working at all at present.
      This is pure recreation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he turned towards his easel, and began hastily to bundle up
      his things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite ready to go yet,&rdquo; said my wife, loath to leave the lovely
      spot. &ldquo;What a curious flat stone this is!&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Percivale. &ldquo;The man to whom the place belongs, a worthy
      yeoman of the old school, says that this wider part of the channel must
      have been the fish-pond, and that the portly monks stood on this stone and
      fished in the pond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then was there a monastery here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. The ruins of the chapel, one of the smallest, are on the top,
      just above the fall&mdash;rather a fearful place to look down from. I
      wonder you did not observe them as you came. They say it had a silver bell
      in the days of its glory, which now lies in a deep hole under the basin,
      half-way between the top and bottom of the fall. But the old man says that
      nothing will make him look, or let anyone else lift the huge stone; for he
      is much better pleased to believe that it may be there, than he would be
      to know it was not there; for certainly, if it were found, it would not be
      left there long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Percivale had continued packing his gear. He now led our party
      up to the chapel, and thence down a few yards to the edge of the chasm,
      where the water fell headlong. I turned away with that fear of high places
      which is one of my many weaknesses; and when I turned again towards the
      spot, there was Wynnie on the very edge, looking over into the flash and
      tumult of the water below, but with a nervous grasp of the hand of
      Percivale, who stood a little farther back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In going home, the painter led us by an easier way out of the valley, left
      his little easel and other things at a cottage, and then walked on in
      front between my wife and daughter, while Turner and I followed. He seemed
      quite at his ease with them, and plenty of talk and laughter rose on the
      way. I, however, was chiefly occupied with finding out Turner&rsquo;s impression
      of Connie&rsquo;s condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is certainly better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder you do not see it as plainly
      as I do. The pain is nearly gone from her spine, and she can move herself
      a good deal more, I am certain, than she could when she left. She asked me
      yesterday if she might not turn upon one side. &lsquo;Do you think you could?&rsquo; I
      asked.&mdash;&lsquo;I think so,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;At any rate, I have often a
      great inclination to try; only papa said I had better wait till you came.&rsquo; 
      I do think she might be allowed a little more change of posture now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have really some hope of her final recovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have <i>hope</i> most certainly. But what is hope in me, you must not
      allow to become certainty in you. I am nearly sure, though, that she can
      never be other than an invalid; that is, if I am to judge by what I know
      of such cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thankful for the hope,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You need not be afraid of my
      turning upon you, should the hope never pass into sight. I should do so
      only if I found that you had been treating me irrationally&mdash;inspiring
      me with hope which you knew to be false. The element of uncertainty is
      essential to hope, and for all true hope, even as hope, man has to be
      unspeakably thankful.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX. THE WALK TO CHURCH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was glad to be able to arrange with a young clergyman who was on a visit
      to Kilkhaven, that he should take my duty for me the next Sunday, for that
      was the only one Turner could spend with us. He and I and Wynnie walked
      together two miles to church. It was a lovely morning, with just a tint of
      autumn in the air. But even that tint, though all else was of the summer,
      brought a shadow, I could see, on Wynnie&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you would show me a poem of&mdash;Vaughan, I think you said, was
      the name of the writer. I am too ignorant of our older literature,&rdquo; said
      Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only just made acquaintance with him,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But I think I
      can repeat the poem. You shall judge whether it is not like Wordsworth&rsquo;s
      Ode.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Happy those early days, when I
  Shined in my angel infancy;
  Before I understood the place
  Appointed for my second race,
  Or taught my soul to fancy ought
  But a white, celestial thought;
  When yet I had not walked above
  A mile or two from my first love,
  And looking back, at that short space,
  Could see a glimpse of his bright face;
  When on some gilded cloud or flower
  My gazing soul would dwell an hour,
  And in those weaker glories spy
  Some shadows of eternity;
  Before I taught my tongue to wound
  My conscience with a sinful sound,
  But felt through all this fleshly dress
  Bright shoots of everlastingness.
  O how I long to travel back&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But here I broke down, for I could not remember the rest with even
      approximate accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did this Vaughan live?&rdquo; asked Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was born, I find, in 1621&mdash;five years, that is, after Shakspere&rsquo;s
      death, and when Milton was about thirteen years old. He lived to the age
      of seventy-three, but seems to have been little known. In politics he was
      on the Cavalier side. By the way, he was a medical man, like you, Turner&mdash;an
      M.D. We&rsquo;ll have a glance at the little book when we go back. Don&rsquo;t let me
      forget to show it you. A good many of your profession have distinguished
      themselves in literature, and as profound believers too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought the profession had been chiefly remarkable for such
      as believe only in the evidence of the senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if having searched into the innermost recesses of the body, and not
      having found a soul, they considered themselves justified in declaring
      there was none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is true of the commonplace amongst them, I do believe. You
      will find the exceptions have been men of fine minds and characters&mdash;not
      such as he of whom Chaucer says,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;His study was but little on the Bible;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      for if you look at the rest of the description of the man, you will find
      that he was in alliance with his apothecary for their mutual advantage,
      that he was a money-loving man, and that some of Chaucer&rsquo;s keenest irony
      is spent on him in an off-hand, quiet manner. Compare the tone in which he
      writes of the doctor of physic, with the profound reverence wherewith he
      bows himself before the poor country-parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Wynnie spoke, though with some tremor in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never know, papa, what people mean by talking about childhood in that
      way. I never seem to have been a bit younger and more innocent than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember a time, Wynnie, when the things about you&mdash;the
      sky and the earth, say&mdash;seemed to you much grander than they seem
      now? You are old enough to have lost something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought for a little while before she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dreams were, I know. I cannot say so of anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I in my turn had to be silent, for I did not see the true answer, though I
      was sure there was one somewhere, if I could only find it. All I could
      reply, however, even after I had meditated a good while, was&mdash;and
      perhaps, after all, it was the best thing I could have said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must make a good use of your dreams, my child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are the only memorials of childhood you have left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to make a good use of them? I don&rsquo;t know what to do with my
      silly old dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she gave a sigh as she spoke that testified her silly old dreams had a
      charm for her still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your dreams, my child, have ever testified to you of a condition of
      things beyond that which you see around you, if they have been to you the
      hints of a wonder and glory beyond what visits you now, you must not call
      them silly, for they are just what the scents of Paradise borne on the air
      were to Adam and Eve as they delved and spun, reminding them that they
      must aspire yet again through labour into that childhood of obedience
      which is the only paradise of humanity&mdash;into that oneness with the
      will of the Father, which our race, our individual selves, need just as
      much as if we had personally fallen with Adam, and from which we fall
      every time we are disobedient to the voice of the Father within our souls&mdash;to
      the conscience which is his making and his witness. If you have had no
      childhood, my Wynnie, yet permit your old father to say that everything I
      see in you indicates more strongly in you than in most people that it is
      this childhood after which you are blindly longing, without which you find
      that life is hardly to be endured. Thank God for your dreams, my child. In
      him you will find that the essence of those dreams is fulfilled. We are
      saved by hope, Turner. Never man hoped too much, or repented that he had
      hoped. The plague is that we don&rsquo;t hope in God half enough. The very fact
      that hope is strength, and strength the outcome, the body of life, shows
      that hope is at one with life, with the very essence of what says &lsquo;I am&rsquo;&mdash;yea,
      of what doubts and says &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; and therefore is reasonable to creatures
      who cannot even doubt save in that they live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time, for I have, of course, only given the outlines, or rather
      salient points, of our conversation, we had reached the church, where, if
      I found the sermon neither healing nor inspiring, I found the prayers full
      of hope and consolation. They at least are safe beyond human caprice,
      conceit, or incapacity. Upon them, too, the man who is distressed at the
      thought of how little of the needful food he had been able to provide for
      his people, may fall back for comfort, in the thought that there at least
      was what ought to have done them good, what it was well worth their while
      to go to church for. But I did think they were too long for any individual
      Christian soul, to sympathise with from beginning to end, that is, to
      respond to, like organ-tube to the fingered key, in every touch of the
      utterance of the general Christian soul. For my reader must remember that
      it is one thing to read prayers and another to respond; and that I had had
      very few opportunities of being in the position of the latter duty. I had
      had suspicions before, and now they were confirmed&mdash;that the present
      crowding of services was most inexpedient. And as I pondered on the
      matter, instead of trying to go on praying after I had already uttered my
      soul, which is but a heathenish attempt after much speaking, I thought how
      our Lord had given us such a short prayer to pray, and I began to wonder
      when or how the services came to be so heaped the one on the back of the
      other as they now were. No doubt many people defended them; no doubt many
      people could sit them out; but how many people could pray from beginning
      to end of them I On this point we had some talk as we went home. Wynnie
      was opposed to any change of the present use on the ground that we should
      only have the longer sermons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I do not think even that so great an evil. A sensitive
      conscience will not reproach itself so much for not listening to the whole
      of a sermon, as for kneeling in prayer and not praying. I think myself,
      however, that after the prayers are over, everyone should be at liberty to
      go out and leave the sermon unheard, if he pleases. I think the result
      would be in the end a good one both for parson and people. It would break
      through the deadness of this custom, this use and wont. Many a young mind
      is turned for life against the influences of church-going&mdash;one of the
      most sacred influences when <i>pure</i>, that is, un-mingled with
      non-essentials&mdash;just by the feeling that he <i>must</i> do so and so,
      that he must go through a certain round of duty. It is a willing service
      that the Lord wants; no forced devotions are either acceptable to him, or
      other than injurious to the worshipper, if such he can be called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After an early dinner, I said to Turner&mdash;&ldquo;Come out with me, and we
      will read that poem of Vaughan&rsquo;s in which I broke down today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa!&rdquo; said Connie, in a tone of injury, from the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, my dear?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be as good for us as for Mr. Turner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite, my dear. Well, I will keep it for the evening, and meantime Mr.
      Turner and I will go and see if we can find out anything about the change
      in the church-service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I had thrown into my bag as I left the rectory a copy of <i>The
      Clergyman&rsquo;s Vade Mecum</i>&mdash;a treatise occupied with the externals of
      the churchman&rsquo;s relations&mdash;in which I soon came upon the following
      passage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So then it appears that the common practice of reading all three
      together, is an innovation, and if an ancient or infirm clergyman do read
      them at two or three several times, he is more strictly conformable;
      however, this is much better than to omit any part of the liturgy, or to
      read all three offices into one, as is now commonly done, without any
      pause or distinction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the part of the clergyman, you see, Turner,&rdquo; I said, when I had
      finished reading the whole passage to him. &ldquo;There is no care taken of the
      delicate women of the congregation, but only of the ancient or infirm
      clergyman. And the logic, to say the least, is rather queer: is it only in
      virtue of his antiquity and infirmity that he is to be upheld in being
      more strictly conformable? The writer&rsquo;s honesty has its heels trodden upon
      by the fear of giving offence. Nevertheless there should perhaps be a
      certain slowness to admit change, even back to a more ancient form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can quite agree with you there,&rdquo; said Turner. &ldquo;If the
      form is better, no one should hesitate to advocate the change. If it is
      worse, then slowness is not sufficient&mdash;utter obstinacy is the right
      condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Turner. For the right must be the rule, and where <i>the
      right</i> is beyond our understanding or our reach, then <i>the better</i>,
      as indeed not only right compared with the other, but the sole ascent
      towards the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening I took Henry Vaughan&rsquo;s poems into the common sitting-room,
      and to Connie&rsquo;s great delight read the whole of the lovely, though unequal
      little poem, called &ldquo;The Retreat,&rdquo; in recalling which I had failed in the
      morning. She was especially delighted with the &ldquo;white celestial thought,&rdquo;
       and the &ldquo;bright shoots of everlastingness.&rdquo; Then I gave a few lines from
      another yet more unequal poem, worthy in themselves of the best of the
      other. I quote the first strophe entire:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  CHILDHOOD.

  &ldquo;I cannot reach it; and my striving eye
  Dazzles at it, as at eternity.
  Were now that chronicle alive,
  Those white designs which children drive,
  And the thoughts of each harmless hour,
  With their content too in my power,
  Quickly would I make my path even,
  And by mere playing go to heaven.

</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  And yet the practice worldlings call
  Business and weighty action all,
  Checking the poor child for his play,
  But gravely cast themselves away.

</pre>
    <hr />
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  An age of mysteries! which he
  Must live twice that would God&rsquo;s face see;
  Which angels guard, and with it play,
  Angels! which foul men drive away.
  How do I study now, and scan
  Thee more than ere I studied man,
  And only see through a long night
  Thy edges and thy bordering light I
  O for thy centre and midday!
  For sure that is the <i>narrow way!</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For of such is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; said my wife softly, as I closed
      the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have the book, papa?&rdquo; said Connie, holding out her thin white cloud
      of a hand to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my child. And if Wynnie would read it with you, she will feel
      more of the truth of what Mr. Percivale was saying to her about finish.
      Here are the finest, grandest thoughts, set forth sometimes with such
      carelessness, at least such lack of neatness, that, instead of their
      falling on the mind with all their power of loveliness, they are like a
      beautiful face disfigured with patches, and, what is worse, they put the
      mind out of the right, quiet, unquestioning, open mood, which is the only
      fit one for the reception of such true things as are embodied in the
      poems. But they are too beautiful after all to be more than a little
      spoiled by such a lack of the finish with which Art ends off all her
      labours. A gentleman, however, thinks it of no little importance to have
      his nails nice as well as his face and his shirt.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X. THE OLD CASTLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The place Turner had chosen suited us all so well, that after attending to
      my duties on the two following Sundays at Kilkhaven, I returned on the
      Monday or Tuesday to the farmhouse. But Turner left us in the middle of
      the second week, for he could not be longer absent from his charge at
      home, and we missed him much. It was some days before Connie was quite as
      cheerful again as usual. I do not mean that she was in the least gloomy&mdash;that
      she never was; she was only a little less merry. But whether it was that
      Turner had opened our eyes, or that she had visibly improved since he
      allowed her to make a little change in her posture&mdash;certainly she
      appeared to us to have made considerable progress, and every now and then
      we were discovering some little proof of the fact. One evening, while we
      were still at the farm, she startled us by calling out suddenly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, papa! I moved my big toe! I did indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were all about her in a moment. But I saw that she was excited, and
      fearing a reaction I sought to calm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; I said, as quietly as I could, &ldquo;you are probably still
      aware that you are possessed of two big toes: which of them are we to
      congratulate on this first stride in the march of improvement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke out in the merriest laugh. A pause followed in which her face
      wore a puzzled expression. Then she said all at once, &ldquo;Papa, it is very
      odd, but I can&rsquo;t tell which of them,&rdquo; and burst into tears. I was afraid
      that I had done more harm than good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not of the slightest consequence, my child,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You have had
      so little communication with the twins of late, that it is no wonder you
      should not be able to tell the one from the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again through her sobs, but was silent, with shining face, for
      the rest of the evening. Our hopes took a fresh start, but we heard no
      more from her of her power over her big toe. As often as I inquired she
      said she was afraid she had made a mistake, for she had not had another
      hint of its existence. Still I thought it could not have been a fancy, and
      I would cleave to my belief in the good sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percivale called to see us several times, but always appeared anxious not
      to intrude more of his society upon us than might be agreeable. He grew in
      my regard, however; and at length I asked him if he would assist me in
      another surprise which I meditated for my companions, and this time for
      Connie as well, and which I hoped would prevent the painful influences of
      the sight of the sea from returning upon them when they went back to
      Kilkhaven: they must see the sea from a quite different shore first. In a
      word I would take them to Tintagel, of the near position of which they
      were not aware, although in some of our walks we had seen the ocean in the
      distance. An early day was fixed for carrying out our project, and I
      proceeded to get everything ready. The only difficulty was to find a
      carriage in the neighbourhood suitable for receiving Connie&rsquo;s litter. In
      this, however, I at length succeeded, and on the morning of a glorious day
      of blue and gold, we set out for the little village of Trevenna, now far
      better known than at the time of which I write. Connie had been out every
      day since she came, now in one part of the fields, now in another,
      enjoying the expanse of earth and sky, but she had had no drive, and
      consequently had seen no variety of scenery. Therefore, believing she was
      now thoroughly able to bear it, I quite reckoned of the good she would get
      from the inevitable excitement. We resolved, however, after finding how
      much she enjoyed the few miles&rsquo; drive, that we would not demand more, of
      her strength that day, and therefore put up at the little inn, where,
      after ordering dinner, Percivale and I left the ladies, and sallied forth
      to reconnoitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked through the village and down the valley beyond, sloping steeply
      between hills towards the sea, the opening closed at the end by the blue
      of the ocean below and the more ethereal blue of the sky above. But when
      we reached the mouth of the valley we found that we were not yet on the
      shore, for a precipice lay between us and the little beach below. On the
      left a great peninsula of rock stood out into the sea, upon which rose the
      ruins of the keep of Tintagel, while behind on the mainland stood the
      ruins of the castle itself, connected with the other only by a narrow
      isthmus. We had read that this peninsula had once been an island, and that
      the two parts of the castle were formerly connected by a drawbridge.
      Looking up at the great gap which now divided the two portions, it seemed
      at first impossible to believe that they had ever been thus united; but a
      little reflection cleared up the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that the isthmus, of half the height of the two parts
      connected by it, had been formed entirely by the fall of portions of the
      rock and soil on each side into the narrow dividing space, through which
      the waters of the Atlantic had been wont to sweep. And now the fragments
      of walls stood on the very verge of the precipice, and showed that large
      portions of the castle itself had fallen into the gulf between. We turned
      to the left along the edge of the rock, and so by a narrow path reached
      and crossed to the other side of the isthmus. We then found that the path
      led to the foot of the rock, formerly island, of the keep, and thence in a
      zigzag up the face of it to the top. We followed it, and after a great
      climb reached a door in a modern battlement. Entering, we found ourselves
      amidst grass, and ruins haggard with age. We turned and surveyed the path
      by which we had come. It was steep and somewhat difficult. But the outlook
      was glorious. It was indeed one of God&rsquo;s mounts of vision upon which we
      stood. The thought, &ldquo;O that Connie could see this!&rdquo; was swelling in my
      heart, when Percivale broke the silence&mdash;not with any remark on the
      glory around us, but with the commonplace question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got your man with you, I think, Mr. Walton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;we thought it better to leave him to look after the
      boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a few minutes, while I gazed in delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it would be possible to bring Miss Constance
      up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I almost started at the idea, and had not replied before he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be something for her to recur to with delight all the rest of
      her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would indeed. But it is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think so&mdash;if you would allow me the honour to assist you. I
      think we could do it perfectly between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was again silent for a while. Looking down on the way we had come, it
      seemed an almost dreadful undertaking. Percivale spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we shall come here to-morrow, we need not explore the place now. Shall
      we go down at once and observe the whole path, with a view to the
      practicability of carrying her up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no objection to that,&rdquo; I answered, as a little hope, and
      courage with it, began to dawn in my heart. &ldquo;But you must allow it does
      not look very practicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would seem more so to you, if you had come up with the idea in
      your head all the way, as I did. Any path seems more difficult in looking
      back than at the time when the difficulties themselves have to be met and
      overcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but then you must remember that we have to take the way back whether
      we will or no, if we once take the way forward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; and now I will go down with the descent in my head as well as under
      my feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there can be no harm in reconnoitring it at least. Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we can rest almost as often as we please,&rdquo; said Percivale, and
      turned to lead the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was steep, and required care even in our own descent; but for
      a man who had climbed mountains, as I had done in my youth, it could
      hardly be called difficult even in middle age. By the time we had got
      again into the valley road I was all but convinced of the practicability
      of the proposal. I was a little vexed, however, I must confess, that a
      stranger should have thought of giving such a pleasure to Connie, when the
      bare wish that she might have enjoyed it had alone arisen in my mind. I
      comforted myself with the reflection that this was one of the ways in
      which we were to be weaned from the world and knit the faster to our
      fellows. For even the middle-aged, in the decay of their daring, must look
      for the fresh thought and the fresh impulse to the youth which follows at
      their heels in the march of life. Their part is to <i>will</i> the
      relation and the obligation, and so, by love to and faith in the young,
      keep themselves in the line along which the electric current flows, till
      at length they too shall once more be young and daring in the strength of
      the Lord. A man must always seek to rise above his moods and feelings, to
      let them move within him, but not allow them to storm or gloom around him.
      By the time we reached home we had agreed to make the attempt, and to
      judge by the path to the foot of the rock, which was difficult in parts,
      whether we should be likely to succeed, without danger, in attempting the
      rest of the way and the following descent. As soon as we had arrived at
      this conclusion, I felt so happy in the prospect that I grew quite merry,
      especially after we had further agreed that, both for the sake of her
      nerves and for the sake of the lordly surprise, we should bind Connie&rsquo;s
      eyes so that she should see nothing till we had placed her in a certain
      position, concerning the preferableness of which we were not of two minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mischief have you two been about?&rdquo; said my wife, as we entered our
      room in the inn, where the cloth was already laid for dinner. &ldquo;You look
      just like two schoolboys that have been laying some plot, and can hardly
      hold their tongues about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been enjoying our little walk amazingly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;So much
      so, that we mean to set out for another the moment dinner is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will take Wynnie with you then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you, my love,&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I will stay with Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You, and Connie too, shall go out to-morrow, for we have found
      a place we want to take you to. And, indeed, I believe it was our
      anticipation of the pleasure you and she would have in the view that made
      us so merry when you accused us of plotting mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife replied only with a loving look, and dinner appearing at this
      moment, we sat down a happy party.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that was over&mdash;and a very good dinner it was, just what I like,
      homely in material but admirable in cooking&mdash;Wynnie and Percivale and
      I set out again. For as Percivale and I came back in the morning we had
      seen the church standing far aloft and aloof on the other side of the
      little valley, and we wanted to go to it. It was rather a steep climb, and
      Wynnie accepted Percivale&rsquo;s offered arm. I led the way, therefore, and
      left them to follow&mdash;not so far in the rear, however, but that I
      could take a share in the conversation. It was some little time before any
      arose, and it was Wynnie who led the way into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of things do you like best to paint, Mr. Percivale?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated for several seconds, which between a question and an answer
      look so long, that most people would call them minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather you should see some of my pictures&mdash;I should prefer
      that to answering your question,&rdquo; he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have seen some of your pictures,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. Indeed you have not, Miss Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I have seen some of your sketches and studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of my sketches&mdash;none of my studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you make use of your sketches for your pictures, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never of such as you have seen. They are only a slight antidote to my
      pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder at that. But I would rather, I repeat, say nothing about
      my pictures till you see some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how am I to have that pleasure, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to London sometimes, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very rarely. More rarely still when the Royal Academy is open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not matter much. My pictures are seldom to be found there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not care to send them there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send one, at least, every year. But they are rarely accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a very improper question, I thought; but if Wynnie had thought so
      she would not have put it. He hesitated a little before he replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly for me to say why,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I cannot wonder much
      at it, considering the subjects I choose.&mdash;But I daresay,&rdquo; he added,
      in a lighter tone, &ldquo;after all, that has little to do with it, and there is
      something about the things themselves that precludes a favourable
      judgment. I avoid thinking about it. A man ought to try to look at his own
      work as if it were none of his, but not as with the eyes of other people.
      That is an impossibility, and the attempt a bewilderment. It is with his
      own eyes he must look, with his own judgment he must judge. The only
      effort is to get it set far away enough from him to be able to use his own
      eyes and his own judgment upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see what you mean. A man has but his own eyes and his own
      judgment. To look with those of other people is but a fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. You understand me quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said no more in explanation of his rejection by the Academy. Till we
      reached the church, nothing more of significance passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a waste, bare churchyard that was! It had two or three lych-gates,
      but they had no roofs. They were just small enclosures, with the low stone
      tables, to rest the living from the weight of the dead, while the
      clergyman, as the keeper of heaven&rsquo;s wardrobe, came forth to receive the
      garment they restored&mdash;to be laid aside as having ended its work, as
      having been worn done in the winds, and rains, and labours of the world.
      Not a tree stood in that churchyard. Hank grass was the sole covering of
      the soil heaved up with the dead beneath. What blasts from the awful space
      of the sea must rush athwart the undefended garden! The ancient church
      stood in the midst, with its low, strong, square tower, and its long,
      narrow nave, the ridge bowed with age, like the back of a horse worn out
      in the service of man, and its little homely chancel, like a small cottage
      that had leaned up against its end for shelter from the western blasts. It
      was locked, and we could not enter. But of all world-worn, sad-looking
      churches, that one&mdash;sad, even in the sunset&mdash;was the dreariest I
      had ever beheld. Surely, it needed the gospel of the resurrection
      fervently preached therein, to keep it from sinking to the dust with
      dismay and weariness. Such a soul alone could keep it from vanishing
      utterly of dismal old age. Near it was one huge mound of grass-grown
      rubbish, looking like the grave where some former church of the dead had
      been buried, when it could stand erect no longer before the onsets of
      Atlantic winds. I walked round and round it, gathering its architecture,
      and peeping in at every window I could reach. Suddenly I was aware that I
      was alone. Returning to the other side, I found that Percivale was seated
      on the churchyard wall, next the sea&mdash;it would have been less dismal
      had it stood immediately on the cliffs, but they were at some little
      distance beyond bare downs and rough stone walls; he was sketching the
      place, and Wynnie stood beside him, looking over his shoulder. I did not
      interrupt him, but walked among the graves, reading the poor memorials of
      the dead, and wondering how many of the words of laudation that were
      inscribed on their tombs were spoken of them while they were yet alive.
      Yet, surely, in the lives of those to whom they applied the least, there
      had been moments when the true nature, the nature God had given them,
      broke forth in faith and tenderness, and would have justified the words
      inscribed on their gravestones! I was yet wandering and reading, and
      stumbling over the mounds, when my companions joined me, and, without a
      word, we walked out of the churchyard. We were nearly home before one of
      us spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That church is oppressive,&rdquo; said Percivale. &ldquo;It looks like a great
      sepulchre, a place built only for the dead&mdash;the church of the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only that it partakes with the living,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;suffers with
      them the buffetings of life, outlasts them, but shows, like the shield of
      the Red-Cross Knight, the &lsquo;old dints of deep wounds.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, is it not a dreary place to choose for a church to stand in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church must stand everywhere. There is no region into which it must
      not, ought not to enter. If it refuses any earthly spot, it is shrinking
      from its calling. Here this one stands for the sea as for the land,
      high-uplifted, looking out over the waters as a sign of the haven from all
      storms, the rest in God. And down beneath in its storehouse lie the bodies
      of men&mdash;you saw the grave of some of them on the other side&mdash;flung
      ashore from the gulfing sea. It may be a weakness, but one would rather
      have the bones of his friend laid in the still Sabbath of the churchyard
      earth, than sweeping and swaying about as Milton imagines the bones of his
      friend Edward King, in that wonderful &lsquo;Lycidas.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then I told them the
      conversation I had had with the sexton at Kilkhaven. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I went on,
      &ldquo;these fancies are only the ghostly mists that hang about the eastern
      hills before the sun rises. We shall look down on all that with a smile by
      and by; for the Lord tells us that if we believe in him we shall never
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time we were back once more at the inn. We gave Connie a
      description of what we had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brave old church!&rdquo; said Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day I awoke very early, full of the anticipated attempt. I got up
      at once, found the weather most promising, and proceeded first of all to
      have a look at Connie&rsquo;s litter, and see that it was quite sound. Satisfied
      of this, I rejoiced in the contemplation of its lightness and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast I went to Connie&rsquo;s room, and told her that Mr. Percivale
      and I had devised a treat for her. Her face shone at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we want to do it our own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, papa,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let us tie your eyes up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and my ears and my hands too. It would be no good tying my feet,
      when I don&rsquo;t know one big toe from the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to keep up the talk all the way, so that you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t weary of
      the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to carry me somewhere with my eyes tied up. O! how jolly!
      And then I shall see something all at once! Jolly! jolly!&mdash;Getting
      tired!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Even the wind on my face would be pleasure enough
      for half a day. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get tired so soon as you will&mdash;you dear,
      kind papa! I am afraid I shall be dreadfully heavy. But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t jerk
      your arms much. I will lie so still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t mind letting Mr. Percivale help me to carry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Why should I, if he doesn&rsquo;t mind it? He looks strong enough; and I am
      sure he is nice, and won&rsquo;t think me heavier than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then. I will send mamma and Wynnie to dress you at once; and
      we shall set out as soon as you are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clapped her hands with delight, then caught me round the neck and gave
      me one of my own kisses as she called the best she had, and began to call
      as loud as she could on her mamma and Wynnie to come and dress her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a glorious morning. The wind came in little wafts, like
      veins of cool white silver amid the great, warm, yellow gold of the
      sunshine. The sea lay before us a mound of blue closing up the end of the
      valley, as if overpowered into quietness by the lordliness of the sun
      overhead; and the hills between which we went lay like great sheep, with
      green wool, basking in the blissful heat. The gleam from the waters came
      up the pass; the grand castle crowned the left-hand steep, seeming to warm
      its old bones, like the ruins of some awful megatherium in the lighted
      air; one white sail sped like a glad thought across the spandrel of the
      sea; the shadows of the rocks lay over our path, like transient, cool,
      benignant deaths, through which we had to pass again and again to yet
      higher glory beyond; and one lark was somewhere in whose little breast the
      whole world was reflected as in the convex mirror of a dewdrop, where it
      swelled so that he could not hold it, but let it out again through his
      throat, metamorphosed into music, which he poured forth over all as the
      libation on the outspread altar of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of all this we talked to Connie as we went; and every now and then she
      would clap her hands gently in the fulness of her delight, although she
      beheld the splendour only as with her ears, or from the kisses of the wind
      on her cheeks. But she seemed, since her accident, to have approached that
      condition which Milton represents Samson as longing for in his blindness,
      wherein the sight should be
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;through all parts diffused,
  That she might look at will through every pore.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I had, however, arranged with the rest of the company, that the moment we
      reached the cliff over the shore, and turned to the left to cross the
      isthmus, the conversation should no longer be about the things around us;
      and especially I warned my wife and Wynnie that no exclamation of surprise
      or delight should break from them before Connie&rsquo;s eyes were uncovered. I
      had said nothing to either of them about the difficulties of the way,
      that, seeing us take them as ordinary things, they might take them so too,
      and not be uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We never stopped till we reached the foot of the peninsula, <i>née</i>
      island, upon which the keep of Tintagel stands. There we set Connie down,
      to take breath and ease our arms before we began the arduous way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now!&rdquo; said Connie eagerly, lifting her hands in the belief that we
      were on the point of undoing the bandage from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my love, not yet,&rdquo; I said, and she lay still again, only she
      looked more eager than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have tired out you and Mr. Percivale, papa,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percivale laughed so amusedly, that she rejoined roguishly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes! I know every gentleman is a Hercules&mdash;at least, he chooses to
      be considered one! But, notwithstanding my firm faith in the fact, I have
      a little womanly conscience left that is hard to hoodwink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a speech for my wee Connie to make! The best answer and the best
      revenge was to lift her and go on. This we did, trying as well as we might
      to prevent the difference of level between us from tilting the litter too
      much for her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where <i>are</i> you going, papa?&rdquo; she said once, but without a sign of
      fear in her voice, as a little slip I made lowered my end of the litter
      suddenly. &ldquo;You must be going up a steep place. Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself, dear
      papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had changed our positions, and were now carrying her, head foremost, up
      the hill. Percivale led, and I followed. Now I could see every change on
      her lovely face, and it made me strong to endure; for I did find it hard
      work, I confess, to get to the top. It lay like a little sunny pool, on
      which all the cloudy thoughts that moved in some unseen heaven cast
      exquisitely delicate changes of light and shade as they floated over it.
      Percivale strode on as if he bore a feather behind him. I did wish we were
      at the top, for my arms began to feel like iron-cables, stiff and stark&mdash;only
      I was afraid of my fingers giving way. My heart was beating uncomfortably
      too. But Percivale, I felt almost inclined to quarrel with him before it
      was over, he strode on so unconcernedly, turning every corner of the
      zigzag where I expected him to propose a halt, and striding on again, as
      if there could be no pretence for any change of procedure. But I held out,
      strengthened by the play on my daughter&rsquo;s face, delicate as the play on an
      opal&mdash;one that inclines more to the milk than the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length we turned in through the gothic door in the battlemented
      wall, and set our lovely burden down upon the grass&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percivale,&rdquo; I said, forgetting the proprieties in the affected humour of
      being angry with him, so glad was I that we had her at length on the mount
      of glory, &ldquo;why did you go on walking like a castle, and pay no heed to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t speak, did you, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; he returned, with just a shadow
      of solicitude in the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Of course not,&rdquo; I rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, then,&rdquo; he returned, in a tone of relief, &ldquo;how could I? You were my
      captain: how could I give in so long as you were holding on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am afraid the <i>Percivale</i>, without the <i>Mister</i>, came again
      and again after this, though I pulled myself up for it as often as I
      caught myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, papa!&rdquo; said Connie from the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, my dear. Wait till your mamma and Wynnie come. Let us go and
      meet them, Mr. Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, do, papa. Leave me alone here without knowing where I am or what
      kind of a place I am in. I should like to know how it feels. I have never
      been alone in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; I said; and Percivale and I left her alone in the
      ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found Ethelwyn toiling up with Wynnie helping her all she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how could you think of bringing Connie up such an
      awful place? I wonder you dared to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done you see, wife,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;thanks to Mr. Percivale, who has
      nearly torn the breath out of me. But now we must get you up, and you will
      say that to see Connie&rsquo;s delight, not to mention your own, is quite wages
      for the labour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she afraid to find herself so high up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows nothing about it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mean you have left the child there with her eyes tied up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. We could not uncover them before you came. It would spoil
      half the pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let us make haste then. It is surely dangerous to leave her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least; but she must be getting tired of the darkness. Take my
      arm now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Mrs. Walton had better take my arm,&rdquo; said Percivale, &ldquo;and
      then you can put your hand on her back, and help her a little that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We tried the plan, found it a good one, and soon reached the top. The
      moment our eyes fell upon Connie, we could see that she had found the
      place neither fearful nor lonely. The sweetest ghost of a smile hovered on
      her pale face, which shone in the shadow of the old gateway of the keep,
      with light from within her own sunny soul. She lay in such still
      expectation, that you would have thought she had just fallen asleep after
      receiving an answer to a prayer, reminding me of a little-known sonnet of
      Wordsworth&rsquo;s, in which he describes as the type of Death&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;the face of one
  Sleeping alone within a mossy cave
  With her face up to heaven; that seemed to have
  Pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone;
  A lovely beauty in a summer grave.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      [Footnote: <i>Miscellaneous Sonnets</i>, part i.28.]
    </p>
    <p>
      But she heard our steps, and her face awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is mamma come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my darling. I am here,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly well, mamma, thank you. Now, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment more, my love. Now, Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We carried her to the spot we had agreed upon, and while we held her a
      little inclined that she might see the better, her mother undid the
      bandage from her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your hands over her eyes, a little way from them,&rdquo; I said to her as
      she untied the handkerchief, &ldquo;that the light may reach them by degrees,
      and not blind her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ethelwyn did so for a few moments, then removed them. Still for a moment
      or two more, it was plain from her look of utter bewilderment, that all
      was a confused mass of light and colour. Then she gave a little cry, and
      to my astonishment, almost fear, half rose to a sitting posture. One
      moment more and she laid herself gently back, and wept and sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I may admit my reader to a share, though at best but a dim reflex
      in my poor words, of the glory that made her weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the gothic-arched door in the battlemented wall, which stood on
      the very edge of the precipitous descent, so that nothing of the descent
      was seen, and the door was as a framework to the picture, Connie saw a
      great gulf at her feet, full to the brim of a splendour of light and
      colour. Before her rose the great ruins of rock and castle, the ruin of
      rock with castle; rough stone below, clear green happy grass above, even
      to the verge of the abrupt and awful precipice; over it the summer sky so
      clear that it must have been clarified by sorrow and thought; at the foot
      of the rocks, hundreds of feet below, the blue waters breaking in white
      upon the dark gray sands; all full of the gladness of the sun overflowing
      in speechless delight, and reflected in fresh gladness from stone and
      water and flower, like new springs of light rippling forth from the earth
      itself to swell the universal tide of glory&mdash;all this seen through
      the narrow gothic archway of a door in a wall&mdash;up&mdash;down&mdash;on
      either hand. But the main marvel was the look sheer below into the abyss
      full of light and air and colour, its sides lined with rock and grass, and
      its bottom lined with blue ripples and sand. Was it any wonder that my
      Connie should cry aloud when the vision dawned upon her, and then weep to
      ease a heart ready to burst with delight? &ldquo;O Lord God,&rdquo; I said, almost
      involuntarily, &ldquo;thou art very rich. Thou art the one poet, the one maker.
      We worship thee. Make but our souls as full of glory in thy sight as this
      chasm is to our eyes glorious with the forms which thou hast cloven and
      carved out of nothingness, and we shall be worthy to worship thee, O Lord,
      our God.&rdquo; For I was carried beyond myself with delight, and with sympathy
      with Connie&rsquo;s delight and with the calm worship of gladness in my wife&rsquo;s
      countenance. But when my eye fell on Wynnie, I saw a trouble mingled with
      her admiration, a self-accusation, I think, that she did not and could not
      enjoy it more; and when I turned from her, there were the eyes of
      Percivale fixed on me in wonderment; and for the moment I felt as David
      must have felt when, in his dance of undignified delight that he had got
      the ark home again, he saw the contemptuous eyes of Michal fixed on him
      from the window. But I could not leave it so. I said to him&mdash;coldly I
      daresay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Percivale; I forgot for the moment that I was not amongst
      my own family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percivale took his hat off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive my seeming rudeness, Mr. Walton. I was half-envying and
      half-wondering. You would not be surprised at my unconscious behaviour if
      you had seen as much of the wrong side of the stuff as I have seen in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had some idea of what he meant; but this was no time to enter upon a
      discussion. I could only say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart was full, Mr. Percivale, and I let it overflow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me at least share in its overflow,&rdquo; he rejoined, and nothing more
      passed on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next ten minutes we stood in absolute silence. We had set Connie
      down on the grass again, but propped up so that she could see through the
      doorway. And she lay in still ecstasy. But there was more to be seen ere
      we descended. There was the rest of the little islet with its crop of
      down-grass, on which the horses of all the knights of King Arthur&rsquo;s round
      table might have fed for a week&mdash;yes, for a fortnight, without, by
      any means, encountering the short commons of war. There were the ruins of
      the castle so built of plates of the laminated stone of the rocks on which
      they stood, and so woven in or more properly incorporated with the
      outstanding rocks themselves, that in some parts I found it impossible to
      tell which was building and which was rock&mdash;the walls themselves
      seeming like a growth out of the island itself, so perfectly were they in
      harmony with, and in kind the same as, the natural ground upon which and
      of which they had been constructed. And this would seem to me to be the
      perfection of architecture. The work of man&rsquo;s hands should be so in
      harmony with the place where it stands that it must look as if it had
      grown out of the soil. But the walls were in some parts so thin that one
      wondered how they could have stood so long. They must have been built
      before the time of any formidable artillery&mdash;enough only for defence
      from arrows. But then the island was nowhere commanded, and its own steep
      cliffs would be more easily defended than any erections upon it. Clearly
      the intention was that no enemy should thereon find rest for the sole of
      his foot; for if he was able to land, farewell to the notion of any
      further defence. Then there was outside the walls the little chapel&mdash;such
      a tiny chapel! of which little more than the foundation remained, with the
      ruins of the altar still standing, and outside the chancel, nestling by
      its wall, a coffin hollowed in the rock; then the churchyard a little way
      off full of graves, which, I presume, would have vanished long ago were it
      not that the very graves were founded on the rock. There still stood old
      worn-out headstones of thin slate, but no memorials were left. Then there
      was the fragment of arched passage underground laid open to the air in the
      centre of the islet; and last, and grandest of all, the awful edges of the
      rock, broken by time, and carved by the winds and the waters into
      grotesque shapes and threatening forms. Over all the surface of the islet
      we carried Connie, and from three sides of this sea-fortress she looked
      abroad over &ldquo;the Atlantic&rsquo;s level powers.&rdquo; It blew a gentle ethereal
      breeze on the top; but had there been such a wind as I have since stood
      against on that fearful citadel of nature, I should have been in terror
      lest we should all be blown, into the deep. Over the edge she peeped at
      the strange fantastic needle-rock, and round the corner she peeped to see
      Wynnie and her mother seated in what they call Arthur&rsquo;s chair&mdash;a
      canopied hollow wrought in the plated rock by the mightiest of all
      solvents&mdash;air and water; till at length it was time that we should
      take our leave of the few sheep that fed over the place, and issuing by
      the gothic door, wind away down the dangerous path to the safe ground
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we had better tie up your eyes again, Connie?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, in wonderment. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing higher yet, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my love. If there were, you would hardly be able for it to-day, I
      should think. It is only to keep you from being frightened at the
      precipice as you go down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be frightened, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are going to carry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if I should slip? I might, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t mind being tumbled over the precipice, if you do
      it. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be to blame, and I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t, papa.&rdquo; Then she drew my
      head down and whispered in my ear, &ldquo;If I get as much more by being killed,
      as I have got by having my poor back hurt, I&rsquo;m sure it will be well worth
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to smile a reply, for I could not speak one. We took her just as
      she was, and with some tremor on my part, but not a single slip, we bore
      her down the winding path, her face showing all the time that, instead of
      being afraid, she was in a state of ecstatic delight. My wife, I could
      see, was nervous, however; and she breathed a sigh of relief when we were
      once more at the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; I returned, as we set down the litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor papa! I&rsquo;ve pulled his arms to pieces! and Mr. Percivale&rsquo;s too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percivale answered first by taking up a huge piece of stone. Then turning
      towards her, he said, &ldquo;Look here, Miss Connie;&rdquo; and flung it far out from
      the isthmus on which we were resting. We heard it strike on a rock below,
      and then fall in a shower of fragments. &ldquo;My arms are all right, you see,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Wynnie had scrambled down to the shore, where we had not yet
      been. In a few minutes, we still lingering, she came running back to us
      out of breath with the news:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa! Mr. Percivale! there&rsquo;s such a grand cave down there! It goes right
      through under the island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie looked so eager, that Percivale and I glanced at each other, and
      without a word, lifted her, and followed Wynnie. It was a little way that
      we had to carry her down, but it was very broken, and insomuch more
      difficult than the other. At length we stood in the cavern. What a
      contrast to the vision overhead!&mdash;nothing to be seen but the cool,
      dark vault of the cave, long and winding, with the fresh seaweed lying on
      its pebbly floor, and its walls wet with the last tide, for every tide
      rolled through in rising and falling&mdash;the waters on the opposite
      sides of the islet greeting through this cave; the blue shimmer of the
      rising sea, and the forms of huge outlying rocks, looking in at the
      further end, where the roof rose like a grand cathedral arch; and the
      green gleam of veins rich with copper, dashing and streaking the darkness
      in gloomy little chapels, where the floor of heaped-up pebbles rose and
      rose within till it met the descending roof. It was like a going-down from
      Paradise into the grave&mdash;but a cool, friendly, brown-lighted grave,
      which even in its darkest recesses bore some witness to the wind of God
      outside, in the occasional ripple of shadowed light, from the play of the
      sun on the waves, that, fleeted and reflected, wandered across its jagged
      roof. But we dared not keep Connie long in the damp coolness; and I have
      given my reader quite enough of description for one hour&rsquo;s reading. He can
      scarcely be equal to more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My invalids had now beheld the sea in such a different aspect, that I no
      longer feared to go back to Kilkhaven. Thither we went three days after,
      and at my invitation, Percivale took Turner&rsquo;s place in the carriage.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. JOE AND HIS TROUBLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      How bright the yellow shores of Kilkhaven looked after the dark sands of
      Tintagel! But how low and tame its highest cliffs after the mighty rampart
      of rocks which there face the sea like a cordon of fierce guardians! It
      was pleasant to settle down again in what had begun to look like home, and
      was indeed made such by the boisterous welcome of Dora and the boys.
      Connie&rsquo;s baby crowed aloud, and stretched forth her chubby arms at sight
      of her. The wind blew gently around us, full both of the freshness of the
      clean waters and the scents of the down-grasses, to welcome us back. And
      the dread vision of the shore had now receded so far into the past, that
      it was no longer able to hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had called at the blacksmith&rsquo;s house on our way home, and found that he
      was so far better as to be working at his forge again. His mother said he
      was used to such attacks, and soon got over them. I, however, feared that
      they indicated an approaching break-down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Joe might be well enough if he liked. It&rsquo;s all
      his own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I cannot believe that your son is in any way
      guilty of his own illness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a well-behaved lad, my Joe,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but he hasn&rsquo;t learned
      what I had to learn long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make up his mind, and stick to it. To do one thing or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was a woman with a long upper lip and a judicial face, and as she
      spoke, her lip grew longer and longer; and when she closed her mouth in
      mark of her own resolution, that lip seemed to occupy two-thirds of all
      her face under the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is it he won&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind whether he does it or not, if he would only make&mdash;up&mdash;his&mdash;mind&mdash;and&mdash;stick&mdash;to&mdash;it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want him to do, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to do it, I&rsquo;m sure. It&rsquo;s no good to me&mdash;and
      wouldn&rsquo;t be much to him, that I&rsquo;ll be bound. Howsomever, he must please
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought it not very wonderful that he looked gloomy, if there was no
      more sunshine for him at home than his mother&rsquo;s face indicated. Few things
      can make a man so strong and able for his work as a sun indoors, whose
      rays are smiles, ever ready to shine upon him when he opens the door,&mdash;the
      face of wife or mother or sister. Now his mother&rsquo;s face certainly was not
      sunny. No doubt it must have shone upon him when he was a baby. God has
      made that provision for babies, who need sunshine so much that a mother&rsquo;s
      face cannot help being sunny to them: why should the sunshine depart as
      the child grows older?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I must not ask. But I fear your son is very far from
      well. Such attacks do not often occur without serious mischief somewhere.
      And if there is anything troubling him, he is less likely to get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he would let somebody make up his mind for him, and then stick to it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but that is impossible, you know. A man must make up his own mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the time she looked naughty, only after a self-righteous fashion. It
      was evident that whatever was the cause of it, she was not in sympathy
      with her son, and therefore could not help him out of any difficulty he
      might be in. I made no further attempt to learn from her the cause of her
      son&rsquo;s discomfort, clearly a deeper cause than his illness. In passing his
      workshop, we stopped for a moment, and I made an arrangement to meet him
      at the church the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was there before him, and found that he had done a good deal since we
      left. Little remained except to get the keys put to rights, and the rods
      attached to the cranks in the box. To-day he was to bring a carpenter, a
      cousin of his own, with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon arrived, and a small consultation followed. The cousin was a
      bright-eyed, cheruby-cheeked little man, with a ready smile and white
      teeth: I thought he might help me to understand what was amiss in Joseph&rsquo;s
      affairs. But I would not make the attempt except openly. I therefore said
      half in a jocular fashion, as with gloomy, self-withdrawn countenance the
      smith was fitting one loop into another in two of his iron rods,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we could get this cousin of yours to look a little more cheerful.
      You would think he had quarrelled with the sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carpenter showed his white teeth between his rosy lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, you see my cousin Joe is not like the
      rest of us. He&rsquo;s a religious man, is Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how that should make him miserable. It hasn&rsquo;t made me
      miserable. I hope I&rsquo;m a religious man myself. It makes me happy every day
      of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; returned the carpenter, in a thoughtful tone, as he worked
      away gently to get the inside out of the oak-chest without hurting it, &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s the religion, for I don&rsquo;t know; but perhaps it&rsquo;s the way he
      takes it up. He don&rsquo;t look after hisself enough; he&rsquo;s always thinking
      about other people, you see, sir; and it seems to me, sir, that if you
      don&rsquo;t look after yourself, why, who is to look after you? That&rsquo;s common
      sense, <i>I</i> think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious contrast&mdash;the merry friendly face, which shone
      good-fellowship to all mankind, accusing the sombre, pale, sad, severe,
      even somewhat bitter countenance beside him, of thinking too much about
      other people, and too little about himself. Of course it might be correct
      in a way. There is all the difference between a comfortable, healthy
      inclination, and a pained, conscientious principle. It was a smile very
      unlike his cousin&rsquo;s with which Joe heard his remarks on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you will allow, at least, that if everybody would take
      Joe&rsquo;s way of it, there would then be no occasion for taking care of
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because everybody would take care of everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so well, I doubt, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and a great deal better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, that&rsquo;s a long way off; and mean time, <i>who&rsquo;s</i> to take
      care of the odd man like Joe there, that don&rsquo;t look after hisself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, God, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s just where I&rsquo;m out. I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that branch,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw a grateful light mount up in Joe&rsquo;s gloomy eyes as I spoke thus upon
      his side of the question. He said nothing, however; and his cousin
      volunteering no further information, I did not push any advantage I might
      have gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon I made them leave their work, and come home with me to have their
      dinner; they hoped to finish the job before dusk. Harry Cobb and I dropped
      behind, and Joe Harper walked on in front, apparently sunk in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely were we out of the churchyard, and on the road leading to the
      rectory, when I saw the sexton&rsquo;s daughter meeting us. She had almost come
      up to Joe before he saw her, for his gaze was bent on the ground, and he
      started. They shook hands in what seemed to me an odd, constrained, yet
      familiar fashion, and then stood as if they wanted to talk, but without
      speaking. Harry and I passed, both with a nod of recognition to the young
      woman, but neither of us had the ill-manners to look behind. I glanced at
      Harry, and he answered me with a queer look. When we reached the turning
      that would hide them from our view, I looked back almost involuntarily,
      and there they were still standing. But before we reached the door of the
      rectory, Joe got up with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something remarkable in the appearance of Agnes Coombes, the
      sexton&rsquo;s daughter. She was about six-and-twenty, I should imagine, the
      youngest of the family, with a sallow, rather sickly complexion, somewhat
      sorrowful eyes, a smile rare and sweet, a fine figure, tall and slender,
      and a graceful gait. I now saw, I thought, a good hair&rsquo;s-breadth further
      into the smith&rsquo;s affairs. Beyond the hair&rsquo;s-breadth, however, all was
      dark. But I saw likewise that the well of truth, whence I might draw the
      whole business, must be the girl&rsquo;s mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the men had had their dinner and rested a while, they went back to
      the church, and I went to the sexton&rsquo;s cottage. I found the old man seated
      at the window, with his pot of beer on the sill, and an empty plate beside
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, sir,&rdquo; he said, rising, as I put my head in at the door. &ldquo;The
      mis&rsquo;ess ben&rsquo;t in, but she&rsquo;ll be here in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s of no consequence,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Are they all well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All comfortable, sir. It be fine dry weather for them, this, sir. It be
      in winter it be worst for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a snug enough shelter you&rsquo;ve got here. It seems such, anyhow;
      though, to be sure, it is the blasts of winter that find out the weak
      places both in house and body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ben&rsquo;t the wind touch <i>them</i>&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they be safe enough from
      the wind. It be the wet, sir. There ben&rsquo;t much snow in these parts; but
      when it du come, that be very bad for them, poor things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could it be that he was harping on the old theme again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at least this cottage keeps out the wet,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If not, we must
      have it seen to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This cottage du well enough, sir. It&rsquo;ll last my time, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you pitying your family for having to live in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, sir! It&rsquo;s not them. They du well enough. It&rsquo;s my people
      out yonder. You&rsquo;ve got the souls to look after, and I&rsquo;ve got the bodies.
      That&rsquo;s what it be, sir. To be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last exclamation was uttered in a tone of impatient surprise at my
      stupidity in giving all my thoughts and sympathies to the living, and none
      to the dead. I pursued the subject no further, but as I lay in bed that
      night, it began to dawn upon me as a lovable kind of hallucination in
      which the man indulged. He too had an office in the Church of God, and he
      would magnify that office. He could not bear that there should be no
      further outcome of his labour; that the burying of the dead out of sight
      should be &ldquo;the be-all and the end-all.&rdquo; He was God&rsquo;s vicar, the gardener
      in God&rsquo;s Acre, as the Germans call the churchyard. When all others had
      forsaken the dead, he remained their friend, caring for what little
      comfort yet remained possible to them. Hence in all changes of air and sky
      above, he attributed to them some knowledge of the same, and some share in
      their consequences even down in the darkness of the tomb. It was his way
      of keeping up the relation between the living and the dead. Finding I made
      him no reply, he took up the word again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your part, sir, and I&rsquo;ve got mine. You up into the pulpit, and
      I down into the grave. But it&rsquo;ll be all the same by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But when you do go down into your own
      grave, you&rsquo;ll know a good deal less about it than you do now. You&rsquo;ll find
      you&rsquo;ve got other things to think about. But here comes your wife. She&rsquo;ll
      talk about the living rather than the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s natural, sir. She brought &lsquo;em to life, and I buried &lsquo;em&mdash;at
      least, best part of &lsquo;em. If only I had the other two safe down with the
      rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered what the old woman had told me&mdash;that she had two boys <i>in</i>
      the sea; and I knew therefore what he meant. He regarded his drowned boys
      as still tossed about in the weary wet cold ocean, and would have gladly
      laid them to rest in the warm dry churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wiped a tear from the corner of his eye with the back of his hand, and
      saying, &ldquo;Well, I must be off to my gardening,&rdquo; left me with his wife. I
      saw then that, humorist as the old man might be, his humour, like that of
      all true humorists, lay close about the wells of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man seems a little out of sorts,&rdquo; I said to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she answered, with her usual gentleness, a gentleness which
      obedient suffering had perfected, &ldquo;this be the day he buried our Nancy,
      this day two years; and to-day Agnes be come home from her work poorly;
      and the two things together they&rsquo;ve upset him a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Agnes coming this way. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she be in the churchyard, sir. I&rsquo;ve been to the doctor about
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s nothing serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, sir; but you see&mdash;four on &lsquo;em, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s in God&rsquo;s hands, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she be, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you about something, Mrs. Coombes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be that, sir? If I can tell, I will, you may be sure, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know what&rsquo;s the matter with Joe Harper, the blacksmith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They du say it be a consumption, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has he got on his mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got nothing on his mind, sir. He be as good a by as ever stepped, I
      assure you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am sure there is something or other on his mind. He&rsquo;s not so happy
      as he should be. He&rsquo;s not the man, it seems to me, to be unhappy because
      he&rsquo;s ill. A man like him would not be miserable because he was going to
      die. It might make him look sad sometimes, but not gloomy as he looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I believe you be right, and perhaps I know summat. But it&rsquo;s
      part guessing.&mdash;I believe my Agnes and Joe Harper are as fond upon
      one another as any two in the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they not going to be married then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be the pint, sir. I don&rsquo;t believe Joe ever said a word o&rsquo; the sort
      to Aggy. She never could ha&rsquo; kep it from me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the pint again, sir. All as knows him says it&rsquo;s because he be in
      such bad health, and he thinks he oughtn&rsquo;t to go marrying with one foot in
      the grave. He never said so to me; but I think very likely that be it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that matter, Mrs. Coombes, we&rsquo;ve all got one foot in the grave, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be very true, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does your daughter think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she thinks the same. And so they go on talking to each other,
      quiet-like, like old married folks, not like lovers at all, sir. But I
      can&rsquo;t help fancying it have something to do with my Aggy&rsquo;s pale face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And something to do with Joe&rsquo;s pale face too, Mrs. Coombes,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;Thank you. You&rsquo;ve told me more than I expected. It explains everything. I
      must have it out with Joe now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O deary me! sir, don&rsquo;t go and tell him I said anything, as if I wanted
      him to marry my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid. I&rsquo;ll take good care of that. And don&rsquo;t fancy I&rsquo;m
      fond of meddling with other people&rsquo;s affairs. But this is a case in which
      I ought to do something. Joe&rsquo;s a fine fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he be, sir. I couldn&rsquo;t wish a better for a son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put on my hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get me into no trouble with Joe, will ye, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will not, Mrs. Coombes. I should be doing a great deal more harm
      than good if I said a word to make him doubt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went straight to the church. There were the two men working away in the
      shadowy tower, and there was Agnes standing beside, knitting like her
      mother, so quiet, so solemn even, that it did indeed look as if she were a
      long-married wife, hovering about her husband at his work. Harry was
      saying something to her as I went in, but when they saw me they were
      silent, and Agnes gently withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you will get through to-night?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure of it, sir,&rdquo; answered Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be sure of anything, Harry. We are told in the New
      Testament that we ought to say <i>If the Lord will</i>,&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Joe, you&rsquo;re too hard upon Harry,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that the
      Bible means to pull a man up every step like that, till he&rsquo;s afraid to
      speak a word. It was about a long journey and a year&rsquo;s residence that the
      Apostle James was speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, sir. But the principle&rsquo;s the same. Harry can no more be sure of
      finishing his work before it be dark, than those people could be of going
      their long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is perfectly true. But you are taking the letter for the spirit, and
      that, I suspect, in more ways than one. The religion does not lie in not
      being sure about anything, but in a loving desire that the will of God in
      the matter, whatever it be, may be done. And if Harry has not learned yet
      to care about the will of God, what is the good of coming down upon him
      that way, as if that would teach him in the least. When he loves God,
      then, and not till then, will he care about his will. Nor does the
      religion lie in saying, <i>if the Lord will</i>, every time anything is to
      be done. It is a most dangerous thing to use sacred words often. It makes
      them so common to our ear that at length, when used most solemnly, they
      have not half the effect they ought to have, and that is a serious loss.
      What the Apostle means is, that we should always be in the mood of looking
      up to God and having regard to his will, not always writing D.V. for
      instance, as so many do&mdash;most irreverently, I think&mdash;using a
      Latin contraction for the beautiful words, just as if they were a charm,
      or as if God would take offence if they did not make the salvo of
      acknowledgment. It seems to me quite heathenish. Our hearts ought ever to
      be in the spirit of those words; our lips ought to utter them rarely.
      Besides, there are some things a man might be pretty sure the Lord wills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds fine, sir; but I&rsquo;m not sure that I understand what you mean to
      say. It sounds to me like a darkening of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that I had irritated him, and so had in some measure lost ground.
      But Harry struck in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How <i>can</i> you say that now, Joe? <i>I</i> know what the parson means
      well enough, and everybody knows I ain&rsquo;t got half the brains you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reason is, Harry, that he&rsquo;s got something in his head that stands in
      the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s nothing in my head <i>to</i> stand in the way!&rdquo; returned
      Harry, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made me laugh too, and even Joe could not help a sympathetic grin. By
      this time it was getting dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Harry, after all, you won&rsquo;t get through to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think so too, sir. And there&rsquo;s Joe saying, &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo; 
      over and over to himself, though he won&rsquo;t say it out like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe answered only with another grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is, Harry,&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;you must come again on
      Monday. And on your way home, just look in and tell Joe&rsquo;s mother that I
      have kept him over to-morrow. The change will do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, that can&rsquo;t he. I haven&rsquo;t got a clean shirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have a shirt of mine,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll want your
      Sunday clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring them for you, Joe&mdash;before you&rsquo;re up,&rdquo; interposed Harry.
      &ldquo;And then you can go to church with Aggy Coombes, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was just what I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Harry,&rdquo; said Joe angrily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking of what you
      don&rsquo;t know anything about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe, I ben&rsquo;t a fool, if I ben&rsquo;t so religious as you be. You ben&rsquo;t a
      bad fellow, though you be a Methodist, and I ben&rsquo;t a fool, though I be
      Harry Cobb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Harry? Do hold your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean first, and then I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue. I
      mean this&mdash;that nobody with two eyes, or one eye, for that matter, in
      his head, could help seeing the eyes you and Aggy make at each other, and
      why you don&rsquo;t port your helm and board her&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s more
      than I know, but I du say it to be more than I think be fair to the young
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I would when I&rsquo;d answered you as to what I meaned. So no more at
      present; but I&rsquo;ll be over with your clothes afore you&rsquo;re up in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Harry spoke he was busy gathering his tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be in the way, will they, sir?&rdquo; he said, as he heaped them
      together in the furthest corner of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;If I had my way, all the tools used in
      building the church should be carved on the posts and pillars of it, to
      indicate the sacredness of labour, and the worship of God that lies, not
      in building the church merely, but in every honest trade honestly pursued
      for the good of mankind and the need of the workman. For a necessity of
      God is laid upon every workman as well as on St. Paul. Only St. Paul saw
      it, and every workman doesn&rsquo;t, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. I like that way of it. I almost think I could be a little
      bit religious after your way of it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost, Harry!&rdquo; growled Joe&mdash;not unkindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you hold your tongue, Joe,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Leave Harry to me. You may take
      him, if you like, after I&rsquo;ve done with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laughing merrily, but making no other reply than a hearty good-night,
      Harry strode away out of the church, and Joe and I went home together.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had had his tea, I asked him to go out with me for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining aslant upon the downs from over the sea. We rose out
      of the shadowy hollow to the sunlit brow. I was a little in advance of
      Joe. Happening to turn, I saw the light full on his head and face, while
      the rest of his body had not yet emerged from the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Joe,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I want to see you so for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood&mdash;a little surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look just like a man rising from the dead, Joe,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, sir,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will describe yourself to you. Your head and face are full of sunlight,
      the rest of your body is still buried in the shadow. Look; I will stand
      where you are now; and you come here. You will soon see what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We changed places. Joe stared for a moment. Then his face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fancy you don&rsquo;t mean the
      resurrection of the body, but the resurrection of righteousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, Joe. Did it ever strike you that the whole history of the Christian
      life is a series of such resurrections? Every time a man bethinks himself
      that he is not walking in the light, that he has been forgetting himself,
      and must repent, that he has been asleep and must awake, that he has been
      letting his garments trail, and must gird up the loins of his mind&mdash;every
      time this takes place, there is a resurrection in the world. Yes, Joe; and
      every time that a man finds that his heart is troubled, that he is not
      rejoicing in God, a resurrection must follow&mdash;a resurrection out of
      the night of troubled thoughts into the gladness of the truth. For the
      truth is, and ever was, and ever must be, gladness, however much the souls
      on which it shines may be obscured by the clouds of sorrow, troubled by
      the thunders of fear, or shot through with the lightnings of pain. Now,
      Joe, will you let me tell you what you are like&mdash;I do not know your
      thoughts; I am only judging from your words and looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may if you like, sir,&rdquo; answered Joe, a little sulkily. But I was not
      to be repelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up in the sunlight, so that my eyes caught only about half the
      sun&rsquo;s disc. Then I bent my face towards the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part of me is the light shining on now, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the top of your head,&rdquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, then,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;that is just what you are like&mdash;a man
      with the light on his head, but not on his face. And why not on your face?
      Because you hold your head down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it possible, sir, that a man might lose the light on his face, as
      you put it, by doing his duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a difficult question,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I must think before I answer
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; added Joe&mdash;&ldquo;mightn&rsquo;t his duty be a painful one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I think that would rather etherealise than destroy the light.
      Behind the sorrow would spring a yet greater light from the very duty
      itself. I have expressed myself badly, but you will see what I mean.&mdash;To
      be frank with you, Joe, I do not see that light in your face. Therefore I
      think something must be wrong with you. Remember a good man is not
      necessarily in the right. St. Peter was a good man, yet our Lord called
      him Satan&mdash;and meant it of course, for he never said what he did not
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I be wrong when all my trouble comes from doing my duty&mdash;nothing
      else, as far as I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I replied, a sudden light breaking in on my mind, &ldquo;I doubt whether
      what you suppose to be your duty can be your duty. If it were, I do not
      think it would make you so miserable. At least&mdash;I may be wrong, but I
      venture to think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a man to go by, then? If he thinks a thing is his duty, is he not
      to do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly&mdash;until he knows better. But it is of the greatest
      consequence whether the supposed duty be the will of God or the invention
      of one&rsquo;s own fancy or mistaken judgment. A real duty is always something
      right in itself. The duty a man makes his for the time, by supposing it to
      be a duty, may be something quite wrong in itself. The duty of a Hindoo
      widow is to burn herself on the body of her husband. But that duty lasts
      no longer than till she sees that, not being the will of God, it is not
      her duty. A real duty, on the other hand, is a necessity of the human
      nature, without seeing and doing which a man can never attain to the truth
      and blessedness of his own being. It was the duty of the early hermits to
      encourage the growth of vermin upon their bodies, for they supposed that
      was pleasing to God; but they could not fare so well as if they had seen
      the truth that the will of God was cleanliness. And there may be far more
      serious things done by Christian people against the will of God, in the
      fancy of doing their duty, than such a trifle as swarming with worms. In a
      word, thinking a thing is your duty makes it your duty only till you know
      better. And the prime duty of every man is to seek and find, that he may
      do, the will of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think, sir, that a man is likely to be doing what he ought
      not, if he is doing what he don&rsquo;t like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so likely, I allow. But there may be ambition in it. A man must not
      want to be better than the right. That is the delusion of the anchorite&mdash;a
      delusion in which the man forgets the rights of others for the sake of his
      own sanctity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be for the sake of another person, and not for the person&rsquo;s own
      sake at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be; but except it were the will of God for that other person, it
      would be doing him or her a real injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were coming gradually towards what I wanted to make the point in
      question. I wished him to tell me all about it himself, however, for I
      knew that while advice given on request is generally disregarded, to offer
      advice unasked is worthy only of a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are you to know the will of God in every case?&rdquo; asked Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By looking at the general laws of life, and obeying them&mdash;except
      there be anything special in a particular case to bring it under a higher
      law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but that be just what there is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, that may be; but the special conduct may not be
      right for the special case for all that. The speciality of the case may
      not be even sufficient to take it from under the ordinary rule. But it is
      of no use talking generals. Let us come to particulars. If you can trust
      me, tell me all about it, and we may be able to let some light in. I am
      sure there is darkness somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will turn it over in my mind, sir; and if I can bring myself to talk
      about it, I will. I would rather tell you than anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said no more. We watched a glorious sunset&mdash;there never was a
      grander place for sunsets&mdash;and went home.

      CHAPTER XII. A SMALL ADVENTURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Harry came with the clothes. But Joe did not go to
      church. Neither did Agnes make her appearance that morning. They were both
      present at the evening service, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came out of church, it was cloudy and dark, and the wind was
      blowing cold from the sea. The sky was covered with one cloud, but the
      waves tossing themselves against the rocks, flashed whiteness out of the
      general gloom. As the tide rose the wind increased. It was a night of
      surly temper&mdash;hard and gloomy. Not a star cracked the blue above&mdash;there
      was no blue; and the wind was <i>gurly</i>; I once heard that word in
      Scotland, and never forgot it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After one of our usual gatherings in Connie&rsquo;s room, which were much
      shorter here because of the evening service in summer, I withdrew till
      supper should be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have always had, as I think I have incidentally stated before, a
      certain peculiar pleasure in the surly aspects of nature. When I was a
      young man this took form in opposition and defiance; since I had begun to
      grow old the form had changed into a sense of safety. I welcomed such
      aspects, partly at least, because they roused my faith to look through and
      beyond the small region of human conditions in which alone the storm can
      be and blow, and thus induced a feeling like that of the child who lies in
      his warm crib and listens to the howling of one of these same storms
      outside the strong-built house which yet trembles at its fiercer onsets:
      the house is not in danger; or, if it be, that is his father&rsquo;s business,
      not his. Hence it came that, after supper, I put on my great-coat and
      travelling-cap, and went out into the ill-tempered night&mdash;speaking of
      it in its human symbolism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I meant to have a stroll down to the breakwater, of which I have yet said
      little, but which was a favourite resort, both of myself and my children.
      At the further end of it, always covered at high water, was an outlying
      cluster of low rocks, in the heart of which the lord of the manor, a
      noble-hearted Christian gentleman of the old school, had constructed a
      bath of graduated depth&mdash;an open-air swimming-pool&mdash;the only
      really safe place for men who were swimmers to bathe in. Thither I was in
      the habit of taking my two little men every morning, and bathing with
      them, that I might develop the fish that was in them; for, as George
      Herbert says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Man is everything,
  And more: he is a tree, yet bears no fruit;
  A beast, yet is, or should be, more;&rdquo;

      and he might have gone on to say that he is, or should be, a fish as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will seem strange to any reader who can recall the position of my
      Connie&rsquo;s room, that the nearest way to the breakwater should be through
      that room; but so it was. I mention the fact because I want my readers to
      understand a certain peculiarity of the room. By the side of the window
      which looked out upon the breakwater was a narrow door, apparently of a
      closet or cupboard, which communicated, however, with a narrow, curving,
      wood-built passage, leading into a little wooden hut, the walls of which
      were by no means impervious to the wind, for they were formed of
      outside-planks, with the bark still upon them. From this hut one or two
      little windows looked seaward, and a door led out on the bit of sward in
      which lay the flower-bed under Connie&rsquo;s window. From this spot again a
      door in the low wall and thick hedge led out on the downs, where a path
      wound along the cliffs that formed the side of the bay, till, descending
      under the storm-tower, it brought you to the root of the breakwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mole stretched its long strong low back to a rock a good way out,
      breaking the force of the waves, and rendering the channel of a small
      river, that here flowed into the sea across the sands from the mouth of
      the canal, a refuge from the Atlantic. But it was a roadway often hard to
      reach. In fair weather even, the wind falling as the vessel rounded the
      point of the breakwater into the calm of the projecting headlands, the
      under-current would sometimes dash her helpless on the rocks. During all
      this heavenly summer there had been no thought or fear of any such
      disaster. The present night was a hint of what weather would yet come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went into Connie&rsquo;s room, I found her lying in bed a very picture of
      peace. But my entrance destroyed the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why have you got your coat on? Surely you are not going
      out to-night. The wind is blowing dreadfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very dreadfully, Connie. It blew much worse the night we found your
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is very dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allow that; but there is a glimmer from the sea. I am only going on the
      breakwater for a few minutes. You know I like a stormy night quite as much
      as a fine one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be miserable till you come home, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Connie. You don&rsquo;t think your father hasn&rsquo;t sense to take care
      of himself! Or rather, Connie, for I grant that is poor ground of comfort,
      you don&rsquo;t think I can go anywhere without my Father to take care of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is no occasion&mdash;is there, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I should be better pleased with my boys if they shrunk from
      everything involving the least possibility of danger because there was no
      occasion for it? That is just the way to make cowards. And I am certain
      God would not like his children to indulge in such moods of
      self-preservation as that. He might well be ashamed of them. The fearful
      are far more likely to meet with accidents than the courageous. But
      really, Connie, I am almost ashamed of talking so. It is all your fault.
      There is positively no ground for apprehension, and I hope you won&rsquo;t spoil
      my walk by the thought that my foolish little girl is frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be good&mdash;indeed I will, papa,&rdquo; she said, holding up her mouth
      to kiss me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I left her room, and went through the wooden passage into the bark hut.
      The wind roared about it, shook it, and pawed it, and sung and whistled in
      the chinks of the planks. I went out and shut the door. That moment the
      wind seized upon me, and I had to fight with it. When I got on the path
      leading along the edge of the downs, I felt something lighter than any
      feather fly in my face. When I put up my hand, I found my cheek wet. Again
      and again I was thus assailed, but when I got to the breakwater I found
      what it was. They were flakes of foam, bubbles worked up into little
      masses of adhering thousands, which the wind blew off the waters and
      across the downs, carrying some of them miles inland. When I reached the
      breakwater, and looked along its ridge through the darkness of the night,
      I was bewildered to see a whiteness lying here and there in a great patch
      upon its top. They were but accumulations of these foam-flakes, like
      soap-suds, lying so thick that I expected to have to wade through them,
      only they vanished at the touch of my feet. Till then I had almost
      believed it was snow I saw. On the edge of the waves, in quieter spots,
      they lay like yeast, foaming and working. Now and then a little rush of
      water from a higher wave swept over the top of the broad breakwater, as
      with head bowed sideways against the wind, I struggled along towards the
      rock at its end; but I said to myself, &ldquo;The tide is falling fast, and salt
      water hurts nobody,&rdquo; and struggled on over the huge rough stones of the
      mighty heap, outside which the waves were white with wrath, inside which
      they had fallen asleep, only heaving with the memory of their late unrest.
      I reached the tall rock at length, climbed the rude stair leading up to
      the flagstaff, and looked abroad, if looking it could be called, into the
      thick dark. But the wind blew so strong on the top that I was glad to
      descend. Between me and the basin where yesterday morning I had bathed in
      still water and sunshine with my boys, rolled the deathly waves. I
      wandered on the rough narrow space yet uncovered, stumbling over the
      stones and the rocky points between which they lay, stood here and there
      half-meditating, and at length, finding a sheltered nook in a mass of
      rock, sat with the wind howling and the waves bursting around me. There I
      fell into a sort of brown study&mdash;almost a half-sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I had not sat long before I came broad awake, for I heard voices, low
      and earnest. One I recognised as Joe&rsquo;s voice. The other was a woman&rsquo;s. I
      could not tell what they said for some time, and therefore felt no
      immediate necessity for disclosing my proximity, but sat debating with
      myself whether I should speak to them or not. At length, in a lull of the
      wind, I heard the woman say&mdash;I could fancy with a sigh&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll du what is right, Joe. Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;e think o&rsquo; me, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just of you that I du think, Aggy. You know it ben&rsquo;t for my sake.
      Surely you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer for a moment. I was still doubting what I had best do&mdash;go
      away quietly or let them know I was there&mdash;when she spoke again.
      There was a momentary lull now in the noises of both wind and water, and I
      heard what she said well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ben&rsquo;t for me to contradict you, Joe. But I don&rsquo;t think you be going to
      die. You be no worse than last year. Be you now, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It flashed across me how once before, a stormy night and darkness had
      brought me close to a soul in agony. Then I was in agony myself; now the
      world was all fair and hopeful around me&mdash;the portals of the world
      beyond ever opening wider as I approached them, and letting out more of
      their glory to gladden the path to their threshold. But here were two
      souls straying in a mist which faith might roll away, and leave them
      walking in the light. The moment was come. I must speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; I called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he cried; and I heard him start to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Mr. Walton. Where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be very far off,&rdquo; he answered, not in a tone of any pleasure at
      finding me so nigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose, and peering about through the darkness, found that they were a
      little higher up on the same rock by which I was sheltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I have been eavesdropping. I had no
      idea anyone was near me till I heard your voices, and I did not hear a
      word till just the last sentence or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw someone go up the Castle-rock,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;but I thought he was
      gone away again. It will be a lesson to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no tell-tale, Joe,&rdquo; I returned, as I scrambled up the rock. &ldquo;You will
      have no cause to regret that I happened to overhear a little. I am sure,
      Joe, you will never say anything you need be ashamed of. But what I heard
      was sufficient to let me into the secret of your trouble. Will you let me
      talk to Joe, Agnes? I&rsquo;ve been young myself, and, to tell the truth, I
      don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m old yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure, sir,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be hard on Joe and me. I don&rsquo;t
      suppose there be anything wrong in liking each other, though we can&rsquo;t be&mdash;married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in a low tone, and her voice trembled very much; yet there was a
      certain womanly composure in her utterance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very bold of me
      to talk so,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;but Joe will tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was close beside them now, and fancied I saw through the dusk the motion
      of her hand stealing into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe, this is just what I wanted,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;A woman can be braver
      than a big smith sometimes. Agnes has done her part. Now you do yours, and
      tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response followed my adjuration. I must help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know how the matter lies, Joe. You think you are not going to
      live long, and that therefore you ought not to marry. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not far off it, sir,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Joe,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we talk as friends about this matter? I have no
      right to intrude into your affairs&mdash;none in the least&mdash;except
      what friendship gives me. If you say I am not to talk about it, I shall be
      silent. To force advice upon you would be as impertinent as useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir. My mind has been made up for a long
      time. What right have I to bring other people into trouble? But I take it
      kind of you, sir, though I mayn&rsquo;t look over-pleased. Agnes wants to hear
      your way of it. I&rsquo;m agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not very encouraging. Still I thought it sufficient ground for
      proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will allow that the root of all Christian behaviour is the
      will of God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not the will of God, then, that when a man and woman love each
      other, they should marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir&mdash;where there be no reasons against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. And you judge you see reason for not doing so, else you
      would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do see that a man should not bring a woman into trouble for the sake of
      being comfortable himself for the rest of a few weary days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agnes was sobbing gently behind her handkerchief. I knew how gladly she
      would be Joe&rsquo;s wife, if only to nurse him through his last illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not except it would make her comfortable too, I grant you, Joe. But
      listen to me. In the first place, you don&rsquo;t know, and you are not required
      to know, when you are going to die. In fact, you have nothing to do with
      it. Many a life has been injured by the constant expectation of death. It
      is life we have to do with, not death. The best preparation for the night
      is to work while the day lasts, diligently. The best preparation for death
      is life. Besides, I have known delicate people who have outlived all their
      strong relations, and been left alone in the earth&mdash;because they had
      possibly taken too much care of themselves. But marriage is God&rsquo;s will,
      and death is God&rsquo;s will, and you have no business to set the one over
      against, as antagonistic to, the other. For anything you know, the
      gladness and the peace of marriage may be the very means intended for your
      restoration to health and strength. I suspect your desire to marry,
      fighting against the fancy that you ought not to marry, has a good deal to
      do with the state of health in which you now find yourself. A man would
      get over many things if he were happy, that he cannot get over when he is
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s for Aggy. You forget that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not forget it. What right have you to seek for her another kind of
      welfare than you would have yourself? Are you to treat her as if she were
      worldly when you are not&mdash;to provide for her a comfort which yourself
      you would despise? Why should you not marry because you have to die soon?&mdash;if
      you <i>are</i> thus doomed, which to me is by no means clear. Why not have
      what happiness you may for the rest of your sojourn? If you find at the
      end of twenty years that here you are after all, you will be rather sorry
      you did not do as I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I find myself dying at the end of six months&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will thank God for those six months. The whole thing, my dear fellow,
      is a want of faith in God. I do not doubt you think you are doing right,
      but, I repeat, the whole thing comes from want of faith in God. You will
      take things into your own hands, and order them after a preventive and
      self-protective fashion, lest God should have ordained the worst for you,
      which worst, after all, would be best met by doing his will without
      inquiry into the future; and which worst is no evil. Death is no more an
      evil than marriage is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t see it as I do,&rdquo; persisted the blacksmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t. I think you see it as it is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent for a little. A shower of spray fell upon us. He
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wave!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That spray came over the top of the rock. We
      shall have to run for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fancied that he only wanted to avoid further conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It was high water an hour and a half ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know this coast, sir,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t talk like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he rose, and going from under the shelter of the rock, looked
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Aggy!&rdquo; he cried in terror, &ldquo;come at once. Every other
      wave be rushing across the breakwater as if it was on the level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he hurried back, caught her by the hand, and began to draw her
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better stay where we are?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can stand the night in the cold. But Aggy here is delicate; and I
      don&rsquo;t care about being out all night. It&rsquo;s not the tide, sir; it&rsquo;s a
      ground swell&mdash;from a storm somewhere out at sea. That never asks no
      questions about tide or no tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But just wait one minute more. It is better
      to be ready for the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For I remembered that the day before I had seen a crowbar lying among the
      stones, and I thought it might be useful. In a moment or two I had found
      it, and returning, gave it to Joe. Then I took the girl&rsquo;s disengaged hand.
      She thanked me in a voice perfectly calm and firm. Joe took the bar in
      haste, and drew Agnes towards the breakwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any real thought of danger had not yet crossed my mind. But when I looked
      along the outstretched back of the mole, and saw a dim sheet of white
      sweep across it, I felt that there was ground for his anxiety, and
      prepared myself for a struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what to do with the crowbar, Joe?&rdquo; I said, grasping my own
      stout oak-stick more firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;To stick between the stones and hold on. We
      must watch our time between the waves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take the command, then, Joe,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;You see better than I do,
      and you know the ways of that raging wild beast there better than I do. I
      will obey orders&mdash;one of which, no doubt, will be, not for wind or
      sea to lose hold of Agnes&mdash;eh, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe gave a grim enough laugh in reply, and we started, he carrying his
      crowbar in his right hand towards the advancing sea, and I my oak-stick in
      my left towards the still water within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; said Joe, and away we went out on the breakwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the back of the breakwater was very rugged, for it was formed of huge
      stones, with wide gaps between, where the waters had washed out the
      cement, and worn their edges. But what impeded our progress secured our
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Joe, when we were yet but a few yards beyond the shelter of
      the rocks. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a topper coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We halted at the word of command, as a huge wave, with combing crest,
      rushed against the far out-sloping base of the mole, and flung its heavy
      top right over the middle of the mass, a score or two of yards in front of
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We did run. In my mind there was just sense enough of danger to add to the
      pleasure of the excitement. I did not know how much danger there was. Over
      the rough worn stones we sped stumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried the smith once more, and we did halt; but this time, as it
      turned out, in the middle front of the coming danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be with us!&rdquo; I exclaimed, when the huge billow showed itself through
      the night, rushing towards the mole. The smith stuck his crowbar between
      two great stones. To this he held on with one hand, and threw the other
      arm round Agnes&rsquo;s waist. I, too, had got my oak firmly fixed, held on with
      one hand, and threw the other arm round Agnes. It took but a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;Here she comes! Hold on, sir. Hold on, Aggy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when I saw the height of the water, as it rushed on us up the sloping
      side of the mound, I cried out in my turn, &ldquo;Down, Joe! Down on your face,
      and let it over us easy! Down Agnes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed. We threw ourselves across the breakwater, with our heads to
      the coming foe, and I grasped my stick close to the stones with all the
      power of a hand that was then strong. Over us burst the mighty wave,
      floating us up from the stones where we lay. But we held on, the wave
      passed, and we sprung gasping to our feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now!&rdquo; cried Joe and I together, and, heavy as we were, with the
      water pouring from us, we flew across the remainder of the heap, and
      arrived, panting and safe, at the other end, ere one wave more had swept
      the surface. The moment we were in safety we turned and looked back over
      the danger we had traversed. It was to see a huge billow sweep the
      breakwater from end to end. We looked at each other for a moment without
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, sir,&rdquo; said Joe at length, with slow and solemn speech, &ldquo;if you
      hadn&rsquo;t taken the command at that moment we should all have been lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems likely enough, when I look back on it. For one thing, I was not
      sure that my stick would stand, so I thought I had better grasp it low
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were awfully near death,&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearer than you thought, Joe; and yet we escaped it. Things don&rsquo;t go all
      as we fancy, you see. Faith is as essential to manhood as foresight&mdash;believe
      me, Joe. It is very absurd to trust God for the future, and not trust him
      for the present. The man who is not anxious is the man most likely to do
      the right thing. He is cool and collected and ready. Our Lord therefore
      told his disciples that when they should be brought before kings and
      rulers, they were to take no thought what answer they should make, for it
      would be given them when the time came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were climbing the steep path up to the downs. Neither of my companions
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have escaped one death together,&rdquo; I said at length: &ldquo;dare another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still neither of them returned an answer. When we came near the parsonage,
      I said, &ldquo;Now, Joe, you must go in and get to bed at once. I will take
      Agnes home. You can trust me not to say anything against you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe laughed rather hoarsely, and replied: &ldquo;As you please, sir. Good night,
      Aggie. Mind you get to bed as fast as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I returned from giving Agnes over to her parents, I made haste to
      change my clothes, and put on my warm dressing-gown. I may as well mention
      at once, that not one of us was the worse for our ducking. I then went up
      to Connie&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, you see, Connie, quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lying listening to every blast of wind since you went out,
      papa. But all I could do was to trust in God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call that <i>all</i>, Connie? Believe me, there is more power in
      that than any human being knows the tenth part of yet. It is indeed <i>all</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said no more then. I told my wife about it that night, but we were well
      into another month before I told Connie.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left her, I went to Joe&rsquo;s room to see how he was, and found him
      having some gruel. I sat down on the edge of his bed, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Joe, this is better than under water. I hope you won&rsquo;t be the worse
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care what comes of me, sir. It will be all over soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ought to care what comes of you, Joe. I will tell you why. You
      are an instrument out of which ought to come praise to God, and,
      therefore, you ought to care for the instrument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That way, yes, sir, I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no business to be like some children who say, &lsquo;Mamma won&rsquo;t
      give me so and so,&rsquo; instead of asking her to give it them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see what you mean, sir. But really you put me out before the young
      woman. I couldn&rsquo;t say before her what I meant. Suppose, you know, sir,
      there was to come a family. It might be, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. What else would you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I was to die, where would she be then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s hands; just as she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I ought to take care that she is not left with a burden like that to
      provide for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Joe! how little you know a woman&rsquo;s heart! It would just be the
      greatest comfort she could have for losing you&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Many a
      woman has married a man she did not care enough for, just that she might
      have a child of her own to let out her heart upon. I don&rsquo;t say that is
      right, you know. Such love cannot be perfect. A woman ought to love her
      child because it is her husband&rsquo;s more than because it is her own, and
      because it is God&rsquo;s more than either&rsquo;s. I saw in the papers the other day,
      that a woman was brought before the Recorder of London for stealing a
      baby, when the judge himself said that there was no imaginable motive for
      her action but a motherly passion to possess the child. It is the need of
      a child that makes so many women take to poor miserable, broken-nosed
      lap-dogs; for they are self-indulgent, and cannot face the troubles and
      dangers of adopting a child. They would if they might get one of a good
      family, or from a respectable home; but they dare not take an orphan out
      of the dirt, lest it should spoil their silken chairs. But that has
      nothing to do with our argument. What I mean is this, that if Agnes really
      loves you, as no one can look in her face and doubt, she will be far
      happier if you leave her a child&mdash;yes, she will be happier if you
      only leave her your name for hers&mdash;than if you died without calling
      her your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took Joe&rsquo;s basin from him, and he lay down. He turned his face to the
      wall. I waited a moment, but finding him silent, bade him good-night, and
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month after, I married them.

      CHAPTER XIII. THE HARVEST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was some time before we got the bells to work to our mind, but at last
      we succeeded. The worst of it was to get the cranks, which at first
      required strong pressure on the keys, to work easily enough. But neither
      Joe nor his cousin spared any pains to perfect the attempt, and, as I say,
      at length we succeeded. I took Wynnie down to the instrument and made her
      try whether she could not do something, and she succeeded in making the
      old tower discourse loudly and eloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the thanksgiving for the harvest was at hand: on the morning
      of that first of all would I summon the folk to their prayers with the
      sound of the full peal. And I wrote a little hymn of praise to the God of
      the harvest, modelling it to one of the oldest tunes in that part of the
      country, and I had it printed on slips of paper and laid plentifully on
      the benches. What with the calling of the bells, like voices in the
      highway, and the solemn meditation of the organ within to bear aloft the
      thoughts of those who heard, and came to the prayer and thanksgiving in
      common, and the message which God had given me to utter to them, I hoped
      that we should indeed keep holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie summoned the parish with the hundredth psalm pealed from aloft,
      dropping from the airy regions of the tower on village and hamlet and
      cottage, calling aloud&mdash;for who could dissociate the words from the
      music, though the words are in the Scotch psalms?&mdash;written none the
      less by an Englishman, however English wits may amuse themselves with
      laughing at their quaintness&mdash;calling aloud,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;All people that on earth do dwell
  Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
  Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell&mdash;
  Come ye before him and rejoice.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then we sang the psalm before the communion service, making bold in the
      name of the Lord to serve him with <i>mirth</i> as in the old version, and
      not with the <i>fear</i> with which some editor, weak in faith, has
      presumed to alter the line. Then before the sermon we sang the hymn I had
      prepared&mdash;a proceeding justifiable by many an example in the history
      of the church while she was not only able to number singers amongst her
      clergy, but those singers were capable of influencing the whole heart and
      judgment of the nation with their songs. Ethelwyn played the organ. The
      song I had prepared was this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;We praise the Life of All;
  From buried seeds so small
  Who makes the ordered ranks of autumn stand;
  Who stores the corn
  In rick and barn
  To feed the winter of the land.

  We praise the Life of Light!
  Who from the brooding night
  Draws out the morning holy, calm, and grand;
  Veils up the moon,
  Sends out the sun,
  To glad the face of all the land.

  We praise the Life of Work,
  Who from sleep&rsquo;s lonely dark
  Leads forth his children to arise and stand,
  Then go their way,
  The live-long day,
  To trust and labour in the land.

  We praise the Life of Good,
  Who breaks sin&rsquo;s lazy mood,
  Toilsomely ploughing up the fruitless sand.
  The furrowed waste
  They leave, and haste
  Home, home, to till their Father&rsquo;s land.

  We praise the Life of Life,
  Who in this soil of strife
  Casts us at birth, like seed from sower&rsquo;s hand;
  To die and so
  Like corn to grow
  A golden harvest in his land.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After we had sung this hymn, the meaning of which is far better than the
      versification, I preached from the words of St. Paul, &ldquo;If by any means I
      might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had
      already attained, either were already perfect.&rdquo; And this is something like
      what I said to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world, my friends, is full of resurrections, and it is not always of
      the same resurrection that St. Paul speaks. Every night that folds us up
      in darkness is a death; and those of you that have been out early and have
      seen the first of the dawn, will know it&mdash;the day rises out of the
      night like a being that has burst its tomb and escaped into life. That you
      may feel that the sunrise is a resurrection&mdash;the word resurrection
      just means a rising again&mdash;I will read you a little description of it
      from a sermon by a great writer and great preacher called Jeremy Taylor.
      Listen. &lsquo;But as when the sun approaching towards the gates of the morning,
      he first opens a little eye of heaven and sends away the spirits of
      darkness, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark to matins, and
      by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud, and peeps over the eastern hills,
      thrusting out his golden horns like those which decked the brows of Moses,
      when he was forced to wear a veil, because himself had seen the face of
      God; and still, while a man tells the story, the sun gets up higher, till
      he shows a fair face and a full light, and then he shines one whole day,
      under a cloud often, and sometimes weeping great and little showers, and
      sets quickly; so is a man&rsquo;s reason and his life.&rsquo; Is not this a
      resurrection of the day out of the night? Or hear how Milton makes his
      Adam and Eve praise God in the morning,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Ye mists and exhalations that now rise
  From hill or streaming lake, dusky or gray,
  Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
  In honour to the world&rsquo;s great Author rise,
  Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,
  Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,
  Rising or falling still advance his praise.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      But it is yet more of a resurrection to you. Think of your own condition
      through the night and in the morning. You die, as it were, every night.
      The death of darkness comes down over the earth; but a deeper death, the
      death of sleep, descends on you. A power overshadows you; your eyelids
      close, you cannot keep them open if you would; your limbs lie moveless;
      the day is gone; your whole life is gone; you have forgotten everything;
      an evil man might come and do with your goods as he pleased; you are
      helpless. But the God of the Resurrection is awake all the time, watching
      his sleeping men and women, even as a mother who watches her sleeping
      baby, only with larger eyes and more full of love than hers; and so, you
      know not how, all at once you know that you are what you are; that there
      is a world that wants you outside of you, and a God that wants you inside
      of you; you rise from the death of sleep, not by your own power, for you
      knew nothing about it; God put his hand over your eyes, and you were dead;
      he lifted his hand and breathed light on you and you rose from the dead,
      thanked the God who raised you up, and went forth to do your work. From
      darkness to light; from blindness to seeing; from knowing nothing to
      looking abroad on the mighty world; from helpless submission to willing
      obedience,&mdash;is not this a resurrection indeed? That St. Paul saw it
      to be such may be shown from his using the two things with the same
      meaning when he says, &lsquo;Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
      and Christ shall give thee light.&rsquo; No doubt he meant a great deal more. No
      man who understands what he is speaking about can well mean only one thing
      at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to return to the resurrections we see around us in nature. Look at
      the death that falls upon the world in winter. And look how it revives
      when the sun draws near enough in the spring to wile the life in it once
      more out of its grave. See how the pale, meek snowdrops come up with their
      bowed heads, as if full of the memory of the fierce winds they encountered
      last spring, and yet ready in the strength of their weakness to encounter
      them again. Up comes the crocus, bringing its gold safe from the dark of
      its colourless grave into the light of its parent gold. Primroses, and
      anemones, and blue-bells, and a thousand other children of the spring,
      hear the resurrection-trumpet of the wind from the west and south, obey,
      and leave their graves behind to breathe the air of the sweet heavens. Up
      and up they come till the year is glorious with the rose and the lily,
      till the trees are not only clothed upon with new garments of loveliest
      green, but the fruit-tree bringeth forth its fruit, and the little
      children of men are made glad with apples, and cherries, and hazel-nuts.
      The earth laughs out in green and gold. The sky shares in the grand
      resurrection. The garments of its mourning, wherewith it made men sad, its
      clouds of snow and hail and stormy vapours, are swept away, have sunk
      indeed to the earth, and are now humbly feeding the roots of the flowers
      whose dead stalks they beat upon all the winter long. Instead, the sky has
      put on the garments of praise. Her blue, coloured after the sapphire-floor
      on which stands the throne of him who is the Resurrection and the Life, is
      dashed and glorified with the pure white of sailing clouds, and at morning
      and evening prayer, puts on colours in which the human heart drowns itself
      with delight&mdash;green and gold and purple and rose. Even the icebergs
      floating about in the lonely summer seas of the north are flashing all the
      glories of the rainbow. But, indeed, is not this whole world itself a
      monument of the Resurrection? The earth was without form and void. The
      wind of God moved on the face of the waters, and up arose this fair world.
      Darkness was on the face of the deep: God said, &lsquo;Let there be light,&rsquo; and
      there was light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the animal world as well, you behold the goings of the Resurrection.
      Plainest of all, look at the story of the butterfly&mdash;so plain that
      the pagan Greeks called it and the soul by one name&mdash;Psyche. Psyche
      meant with them a butterfly or the soul, either. Look how the creeping
      thing, ugly to our eyes, so that we can hardly handle it without a
      shudder, finding itself growing sick with age, straightway falls a
      spinning and weaving at its own shroud, coffin, and grave, all in one&mdash;to
      prepare, in fact, for its resurrection; for it is for the sake of the
      resurrection that death exists. Patiently it spins its strength, but not
      its life, away, folds itself up decently, that its body may rest in quiet
      till the new body is formed within it; and at length when the appointed
      hour has arrived, out of the body of this crawling thing breaks forth the
      winged splendour of the butterfly&mdash;not the same body&mdash;a new one
      built out of the ruins of the old&mdash;even as St. Paul tells us that it
      is not the same body <i>we</i> have in the resurrection, but a nobler body
      like ourselves, with all the imperfect and evil thing taken away. No more
      creeping for the butterfly; wings of splendour now. Neither yet has it
      lost the feet wherewith to alight on all that is lovely and sweet. Think
      of it&mdash;up from the toilsome journey over the low ground, exposed to
      the foot of every passer-by, destroying the lovely leaves upon which it
      fed, and the fruit which they should shelter, up to the path at will
      through the air, and a gathering of food which hurts not the source of it,
      a food which is but as a tribute from the loveliness of the flowers to the
      yet higher loveliness of the flower-angel: is not this a resurrection? Its
      children too shall pass through the same process, to wing the air of a
      summer noon, and rejoice in the ethereal and the pure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To return yet again from the human thoughts suggested by the symbol of
      the butterfly&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here let me pause for a moment&mdash;and there was a corresponding pause,
      though but momentary, in the sermon as I spoke it&mdash;to mention a
      curious, and to me at the moment an interesting fact. At this point of my
      address, I caught sight of a white butterfly, a belated one, flitting
      about the church. Absorbed for a moment, my eye wandered after it. It was
      near the bench where my own people sat, and, for one flash of thought, I
      longed that the butterfly would alight on my Wynnie, for I was more
      anxious about her resurrection at the time than about anything else. But
      the butterfly would not. And then I told myself that God would, and that
      the butterfly was only the symbol of a grand truth, and of no private
      interpretation, to make which of it was both selfishness and superstition.
      But all this passed in a flash, and I resumed my discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;I come now naturally to speak of what we commonly call the
      Resurrection. Some say: &lsquo;How can the same dust be raised again, when it
      may be scattered to the winds of heaven?&rsquo; It is a question I hardly care
      to answer. The mere difficulty can in reason stand for nothing with God;
      but the apparent worthlessness of the supposition renders the question
      uninteresting to me. What is of import is, that I should stand clothed
      upon, with a body which is <i>my</i> body because it serves my ends,
      justifies my consciousness of identity by being, in all that was good in
      it, like that which I had before, while now it is tenfold capable of
      expressing the thoughts and feelings that move within me. How can I care
      whether the atoms that form a certain inch of bone should be the same as
      those which formed that bone when I died? All my life-time I never felt or
      thought of the existence of such a bone! On the other hand, I object to
      having the same worn muscles, the same shrivelled skin with which I may
      happen to die. Why give me the same body as that? Why not rather my
      youthful body, which was strong, and facile, and capable? The matter in
      the muscle of my arm at death would not serve to make half the muscle I
      had when young. But I thank God that St. Paul says it will <i>not</i> be
      the same body. That body dies&mdash;up springs another body. I suspect
      myself that those are right who say that this body being the seed, the
      moment it dies in the soil of this world, that moment is the resurrection
      of the new body. The life in it rises out of it in a new body. This is not
      after it is put in the mere earth; for it is dead then, and the germ of
      life gone out of it. If a seed rots, no new body comes of it. The seed
      dies into a new life, and so does man. Dying and rotting are two very
      different things.&mdash;But I am not sure by any means. As I say, the
      whole question is rather uninteresting to me. What do I care about my old
      clothes after I have done with them? What is it to me to know what becomes
      of an old coat or an old pulpit gown? I have no such clinging to the
      flesh. It seems to me that people believe their bodies to be themselves,
      and are therefore very anxious about them&mdash;and no wonder then. Enough
      for me that I shall have eyes to see my friends, a face that they shall
      know me by, and a mouth to praise God withal. I leave the matter with one
      remark, that I am well content to rise as Jesus rose, however that was.
      For me the will of God is so good that I would rather have his will done
      than my own choice given me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I now come to the last, because infinitely the most important part of
      my subject&mdash;the resurrection for the sake of which all the other
      resurrections exist&mdash;the resurrection unto Life. This is the one of
      which St. Paul speaks in my text. This is the one I am most anxious&mdash;indeed,
      the only one I am anxious to set forth, and impress upon you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, then, of all the deaths you know; the death of the night, when the
      sun is gone, when friend says not a word to friend, but both lie drowned
      and parted in the sea of sleep; the death of the year, when winter lies
      heavy on the graves of the children of summer, when the leafless trees
      moan in the blasts from the ocean, when the beasts even look dull and
      oppressed, when the children go about shivering with cold, when the poor
      and improvident are miserable with suffering or think of such a death of
      disease as befalls us at times, when the man who says, &lsquo;Would God it were
      morning!&rsquo; changes but his word, and not his tune, when the morning comes,
      crying, &lsquo;Would God it were evening!&rsquo; when what life is left is known to us
      only by suffering, and hope is amongst the things that were once and are
      no more&mdash;think of all these, think of them all together, and you will
      have but the dimmest, faintest picture of the death from which the
      resurrection of which I have now to speak, is the rising. I shrink from
      the attempt, knowing how weak words are to set forth <i>the</i> death, set
      forth <i>the</i> resurrection. Were I to sit down to yonder organ, and
      crash out the most horrible dissonances that ever took shape in sound, I
      should give you but a weak figure of this death; were I capable of drawing
      from many a row of pipes an exhalation of dulcet symphonies and voices
      sweet, such as Milton himself could have invaded our ears withal, I could
      give you but a faint figure of this resurrection. Nevertheless, I must try
      what I can do in my own way.

      &ldquo;If into the face of the dead body, lying on the bed, waiting for its
      burial, the soul of the man should begin to dawn again, drawing near from
      afar to look out once more at those eyes, to smile once again through
      those lips, the change on that face would be indeed great and wondrous,
      but nothing for marvel or greatness to that which passes on the
      countenance, the very outward bodily face of the man who wakes from his
      sleep, arises from the dead and receives light from Christ. Too often
      indeed, the reposeful look on the face of the dead body would be troubled,
      would vanish away at the revisiting of the restless ghost; but when a
      man&rsquo;s own right true mind, which God made in him, is restored to him
      again, and he wakes from the death of sin, then comes the repose without
      the death. It may take long for the new spirit to complete the visible
      change, but it begins at once, and will be perfected. The bloated look of
      self-indulgence passes away like the leprosy of Naaman, the cheek grows
      pure, the lips return to the smile of hope instead of the grin of greed,
      and the eyes that made innocence shrink and shudder with their yellow leer
      grow childlike and sweet and faithful. The mammon-eyes, hitherto fixed on
      the earth, are lifted to meet their kind; the lips that mumbled over
      figures and sums of gold learn to say words of grace and tenderness. The
      truculent, repellent, self-satisfied face begins to look thoughtful and
      doubtful, as if searching for some treasure of whose whereabouts it had no
      certain sign. The face anxious, wrinkled, peering, troubled, on whose
      lines you read the dread of hunger, poverty, and nakedness, thaws into a
      smile; the eyes reflect in courage the light of the Father&rsquo;s care, the
      back grows erect under its burden with the assurance that the hairs of its
      head are all numbered. But the face can with all its changes set but dimly
      forth the rising from the dead which passes within. The heart, which cared
      but for itself, becomes aware of surrounding thousands like itself, in the
      love and care of which it feels a dawning blessedness undreamt of before.
      From selfishness to love&mdash;is not this a rising from the dead? The man
      whose ambition declares that his way in the world would be to subject
      everything to his desires, to bring every human care, affection, power,
      and aspiration to his feet&mdash;such a world it would be, and such a king
      it would have, if individual ambition might work its will! if a man&rsquo;s
      opinion of himself could be made out in the world, degrading, compelling,
      oppressing, doing everything for his own glory!&mdash;and such a glory!&mdash;but
      a pang of light strikes this man to the heart; an arrow of truth,
      feathered with suffering and loss and dismay, finds out&mdash;the open
      joint in his armour, I was going to say&mdash;no, finds out the joint in
      the coffin where his heart lies festering in a death so dead that itself
      calls it life. He trembles, he awakes, he rises from the dead. No more he
      seeks the slavery of all: where can he find whom to serve? how can he
      become if but a threshold in the temple of Christ, where all serve all,
      and no man thinks first of himself? He to whom the mass of his fellows, as
      he massed them, was common and unclean, bows before every human sign of
      the presence of the making God. The sun, which was to him but a candle
      with which to search after his own ends, wealth, power, place, praise&mdash;the
      world, which was but the cavern where he thus searched&mdash;are now full
      of the mystery of loveliness, full of the truth of which sun and wind and
      land and sea are symbols and signs. From a withered old age of unbelief,
      the dim eyes of which refuse the glory of things a passage to the heart,
      he is raised up a child full of admiration, wonder, and gladness.
      Everything is glorious to him; he can believe, and therefore he sees. It
      is from the grave into the sunshine, from the night into the morning, from
      death into life. To come out of the ugly into the beautiful; out of the
      mean and selfish into the noble and loving; out of the paltry into the
      great; out of the false into the true; out of the filthy into the clean;
      out of the commonplace into the glorious; out of the corruption of disease
      into the fine vigour and gracious movements of health; in a word, out of
      evil into good&mdash;is not this a resurrection indeed&mdash;<i>the</i>
      resurrection of all, the resurrection of Life? God grant that with St.
      Paul we may attain to this resurrection of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This rising from the dead is often a long and a painful process. Even
      after he had preached the gospel to the Gentiles, and suffered much for
      the sake of his Master, Paul sees the resurrection of the dead towering
      grandly before him, not yet climbed, not yet attained unto&mdash;a
      mountainous splendour and marvel, still shining aloft in the air of
      existence, still, thank God, to be attained, but ever growing in height
      and beauty as, forgetting those things that are behind, he presses towards
      the mark, if by any means he may attain to the resurrection of the dead.
      Every blessed moment in which a man bethinks himself that he has been
      forgetting his high calling, and sends up to the Father a prayer for aid;
      every time a man resolves that what he has been doing he will do no more;
      every time that the love of God, or the feeling of the truth, rouses a man
      to look first up at the light, then down at the skirts of his own garments&mdash;that
      moment a divine resurrection is wrought in the earth. Yea, every time that
      a man passes from resentment to forgiveness, from cruelty to compassion,
      from hardness to tenderness, from indifference to carefulness, from
      selfishness to honesty, from honesty to generosity, from generosity to
      love,&mdash;a resurrection, the bursting of a fresh bud of life out of the
      grave of evil, gladdens the eye of the Father watching his children.
      Awake, then, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ will
      give thee light. As the harvest rises from the wintry earth, so rise thou
      up from the trials of this world a full ear in the harvest of Him who
      sowed thee in the soil that thou mightest rise above it. As the summer
      rises from the winter, so rise thou from the cares of eating and drinking
      and clothing into the fearless sunshine of confidence in the Father. As
      the morning rises out of the night, so rise thou from the darkness of
      ignorance to do the will of God in the daylight; and as a man feels that
      he is himself when he wakes from the troubled and grotesque visions of the
      night into the glory of the sunrise, even so wilt thou feel that then
      first thou knowest what thy life, the gladness of thy being, is. As from
      painful tossing in disease, rise into the health of well-being. As from
      the awful embrace of thy own dead body, burst forth in thy spiritual body.
      Arise thou, responsive to the indwelling will of the Father, even as thy
      body will respond to thy indwelling soul.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;White wings are crossing;
  Glad waves are tossing;
  The earth flames out in crimson and green:

  Spring is appearing,
  Summer is nearing&mdash;

      With this quotation from a friend&rsquo;s poem, I closed my sermon, oppressed
      with a sense of failure; for ever the marvel of simple awaking, the mere
      type of the resurrection eluded all my efforts to fix it in words. I had
      to comfort myself with the thought that God is so strong that he can work
      even with our failures.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A WALK WITH MY WIFE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The autumn was creeping up on the earth, with winter holding by its skirts
      behind; but before I loose my hold of the garments of summer, I must write
      a chapter about a walk and a talk I had one night with my wife. It had
      rained a good deal during the day, but as the sun went down the air began
      to clear, and when the moon shone out, near the full, she walked the
      heavens, not &ldquo;like one that hath been led astray,&rdquo; but as &ldquo;queen and
      huntress, chaste and fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely night it is!&rdquo; said Ethelwyn, who had come into my study&mdash;where
      I always sat with unblinded windows, that the night and her creatures
      might look in upon me&mdash;and had stood gazing out for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go for a little turn?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it very much,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I will go and put on my
      bonnet at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a minute or two she looked in again, all ready. I rose, laid aside my
      Plato, and went with her. We turned our steps along the edge of the down,
      and descended upon the breakwater, where we seated ourselves upon the same
      spot where in the darkness I had heard the voices of Joe and Agnes. What a
      different night it was from that! The sea lay as quiet as if it could not
      move for the moonlight that lay upon it. The glory over it was so mighty
      in its peacefulness, that the wild element beneath was afraid to toss
      itself even with the motions of its natural unrest. The moon was like the
      face of a saint before which the stormy people has grown dumb. The rocks
      stood up solid and dark in the universal aether, and the pulse of the
      ocean throbbed against them with a lapping gush, soft as the voice of a
      passionate child soothed into shame of its vanished petulance. But the sky
      was the glory. Although no breath moved below, there was a gentle wind
      abroad in the upper regions. The air was full of masses of cloud, the
      vanishing fragments of the one great vapour which had been pouring down in
      rain the most of the day. These masses were all setting with one steady
      motion eastward into the abysses of space; now obscuring the fair moon,
      now solemnly sweeping away from before her. As they departed, out shone
      her marvellous radiance, as calm as ever. It was plain that she knew
      nothing of what we called her covering, her obscuration, the dimming of
      her glory. She had been busy all the time weaving her lovely opaline
      damask on the other side of the mass in which we said she was swallowed
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever noticed, wifie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how the eyes of our minds&mdash;almost
      our bodily eyes&mdash;are opened sometimes to the cubicalness of nature,
      as it were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Harry, for I don&rsquo;t understand your question,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a stupid way of expressing what I meant. No human being
      could have understood it from that. I will make you understand in a
      moment, though. Sometimes&mdash;perhaps generally&mdash;we see the sky as
      a flat dome, spangled with star-points, and painted blue. <i>Now</i> I see
      it as an awful depth of blue air, depth within depth; and the clouds
      before me are not passing away to the left, but sinking away from the
      front of me into the marvellous unknown regions, which, let philosophers
      say what they will about time and space,&mdash;and I daresay they are
      right,&mdash;are yet very awful to me. Thank God, my dear,&rdquo; I said,
      catching hold of her arm, as the terror of mere space grew upon me, &ldquo;for
      himself. He is deeper than space, deeper than time; he is the heart of all
      the cube of history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you now, husband,&rdquo; said my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;is it not something the same with the things
      inside us? I can&rsquo;t put it in words as you do. Do you understand me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that I do. You must try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me well enough, only you like to make me blunder where you
      can talk,&rdquo; said my wife, putting her hand in mine. &ldquo;But I will try.
      Sometimes, after thinking about something for a long time, you come to a
      conclusion about it, and you think you have settled it plain and clear to
      yourself, for ever and a day. You hang it upon your wall, like a picture,
      and are satisfied for a fortnight. But some day, when you happen to cast a
      look at it, you find that instead of hanging flat on the wall, your
      picture has gone through it&mdash;opens out into some region you don&rsquo;t
      know where&mdash;shows you far-receding distances of air and sea&mdash;in
      short, where you thought one question was settled for ever, a hundred are
      opened up for the present hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, wife!&rdquo; I cried in true delight. &ldquo;I do indeed understand you now.
      You have said it better than I could ever have done. That&rsquo;s the plague of
      you women! You have been taught for centuries and centuries that there is
      little or nothing to be expected of you, and so you won&rsquo;t try. Therefore
      we men know no more than you do whether it is in you or not. And when you
      do try, instead of trying to think, you want to be in Parliament all at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you apply that remark to me, sir?&rdquo; demanded Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must submit to bear the sins of your kind upon occasion,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am content to do that, so long as yours will help mine,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may go on?&rdquo; I said, with interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till sunrise if you like. We were talking of the cubicalness&mdash;I
      believe you called it&mdash;of nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you capped it with the cubicalness of thought. And quite right too.
      There are people, as a dear friend of mine used to say, who are so
      accustomed to regard everything in the <i>flat</i>, as dogma cut and&mdash;not
      <i>always</i> dried my moral olfactories aver&mdash;that if you prove to
      them the very thing they believe, but after another mode than that they
      have been accustomed to, they are offended, and count you a heretic. There
      is no help for it. Even St. Paul&rsquo;s chief opposition came from the
      Judaizing Christians of his time, who did not believe that God <i>could</i>
      love the Gentiles, and therefore regarded him as a teacher of falsehood.
      We must not be fierce with them. Who knows what wickedness of their
      ancestors goes to account for their stupidity? For that there are stupid
      people, and that they are, in very consequence of their stupidity,
      conceited, who can deny? The worst of it is, that no man who is conceited
      can be convinced of the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Harry. That is to deny conversion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Ethelwyn. The moment a man is convinced of his folly, he
      ceases to be a fool. The moment a man is convinced of his conceit, he
      ceases to be conceited. But there <i>must</i> be a final judgment, and the
      true man will welcome it, even if he is to appear a convicted fool. A
      man&rsquo;s business is to see first that he is not acting the part of a fool,
      and next, to help any honest people who care about the matter to take heed
      likewise that they be not offering to pull the mote out of their brother&rsquo;s
      eye. But there are even societies established and supported by good people
      for the express purpose of pulling out motes.&mdash;&lsquo;The Mote-Pulling
      Society!&rsquo;&mdash;That ought to take with a certain part of the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Harry. You are absurd. Such people don&rsquo;t come near you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t touch me. No. But they come near good people whom I know,
      brandishing the long pins with which they pull the motes out, and
      threatening them with judgment before their time. They are but pins, to be
      sure&mdash;not daggers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have wandered, Harry, into the narrowest underground, musty ways,
      and have forgotten all about &lsquo;the cubicalness of nature.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my love, as you generally are,&rdquo; I answered, laughing.
      &ldquo;Look at that great antlered elk, or moose&mdash;fit quarry for Diana of
      the silver bow. Look how it glides solemnly away into the unpastured
      depths of the aerial deserts. Look again at that reclining giant, half
      raised upon his arm, with his face turned towards the wilderness. What
      eyes they must be under those huge brows! On what message to the nations
      is he borne as by the slow sweep of ages, on towards his mysterious goal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop, Harry,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;It makes me unhappy to hear grand
      words clothing only cloudy fancies. Such words ought to be used about the
      truth, and the truth only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could carry it no further, my dear, then it would indeed be a
      degrading of words. But there never was a vagary that uplifted the soul,
      or made the grand words flow from the gates of speech, that had not its
      counterpart in truth itself. Man can imagine nothing, even in the clouds
      of the air, that God has not done, or is not doing. Even as that cloudy
      giant yields, and is &lsquo;shepherded by the slow unwilling wind,&rsquo; so is each
      of us borne onward to an unseen destiny&mdash;a glorious one if we will
      but yield to the Spirit of God that bloweth where it listeth&mdash;with a
      grand listing&mdash;coming whence we know not, and going whither we know
      not. The very clouds of the air are hung up as dim pictures of the
      thoughts and history of man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mind how long you talk like that, husband, even if you take the
      clouds for your text. But it did make me miserable to think that what you
      were saying had no more basis than the fantastic forms which the clouds
      assume. I see I was wrong, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clouds themselves, in such a solemn stately march as this, used to
      make me sad for the very same reason. I used to think, What is it all for?
      They are but vapours blown by the wind. They come nowhence, and they go
      nowhither. But now I see them and all things as ever moving symbols of the
      motions of man&rsquo;s spirit and destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed, during which we sat and watched the marvellous depth of
      the heavens, deep as I do not think I ever saw them before or since,
      covered with a stately procession of ever-appearing and ever-vanishing
      forms&mdash;great sculpturesque blocks of a shattered storm&mdash;the
      icebergs of the upper sea. These were not far off against a blue
      background, but floating near us in the heart of a blue-black space,
      gloriously lighted by a golden rather than silvery moon. At length my wife
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Mr. Percivale is out to-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How he must be enjoying
      it if he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder the young man is not returning to his professional labours,&rdquo; I
      said. &ldquo;Few artists can afford such long holidays as he is taking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is laying in stock, though, I suppose,&rdquo; answered my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt that, my dear. He said not, on one occasion, you may remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember. But still he must paint better the more familiar he gets
      with the things God cares to fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. But I am afraid the work of God he is chiefly studying at
      present is our Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, is she not a worthy object of his study?&rdquo; returned Ethelwyn,
      looking up in my face with an arch expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless again, Ethel; but I hope she is not studying him quite so much
      in her turn. I have seen her eyes following him about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife made no answer for a moment. Then she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like him, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I like him very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should you not like Wynnie to like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be surer of his principles, for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be surer of Wynnie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent. Ethelwyn resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think they might do each other good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still I could not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They both love the truth, I am sure; only they don&rsquo;t perhaps know what it
      is yet. I think if they were to fall in love with each other, it would
      very likely make them both more desirous of finding it still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; I said at last. &ldquo;But you are talking about awfully serious
      things, Ethelwyn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as serious as life,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me very anxious,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The young man has not, I fear, any
      means of gaining a livelihood for more than himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he before he wanted it? I like to see a man who can be content
      with an art and a living by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I have not been to blame in allowing them to see so much of each
      other,&rdquo; I said, hardly heeding my wife&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came about quite naturally,&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;If you had opposed their
      meeting, you would have been interfering just as if you had been
      Providence. And you would have only made them think more about each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said anything&mdash;has he?&rdquo; I asked in positive alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear no. It may be all my fancy. I am only looking a little ahead. I
      confess I should like him for a son-in-law. I approve of him,&rdquo; she added,
      with a sweet laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I suppose sons-in-law are possible, however disagreeable,
      results of having daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I tried to laugh, but hardly succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you in such a mood. It is not like
      you at all. It is unworthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help being anxious when you speak of such dreadful things as
      the possibility of having to give away my daughter, my precious wonder
      that came to me through you, out of the infinite&mdash;the tender little
      darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Out of the heart of God,&rsquo; you used to say, Henry. Yes, and with a
      destiny he had ordained. It is strange to me how you forget your best and
      noblest teaching sometimes. You are always telling us to trust in God.
      Surely it is a poor creed that will only allow us to trust in God for
      ourselves&mdash;a very selfish creed. There must be something wrong there.
      I should say that the man who can only trust God for himself is not half a
      Christian. Either he is so selfish that that satisfies him, or he has such
      a poor notion of God that he cannot trust him with what most concerns him.
      The former is not your case, Harry: is the latter, then?&mdash;You see I
      must take my turn at the preaching sometimes. Mayn&rsquo;t I, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my hand in both of hers. The truth arose in my heart. I never
      loved my wife more than at that moment. And now I could not speak for
      other reasons. I saw that I had been faithless to my God, and the moment I
      could command my speech, I hastened to confess it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;quite right. I have been wicked, for I
      have been denying my God. I have been putting my providence in the place
      of his&mdash;trying, like an anxious fool, to count the hairs on Wynnie&rsquo;s
      head, instead of being content that the grand loving Father should count
      them. My love, let us pray for Wynnie; for what is prayer but giving her
      to God and his holy, blessed will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat hand in hand. Neither spoke aloud for some minutes, but we spoke in
      our hearts to God, talking to him about Wynnie. Then we rose together, and
      walked homeward, still in silence. But my heart and hand clung to my wife
      as to the angel whom God had sent to deliver me out of the prison of my
      faithlessness. And as we went, lo! the sky was glorious again. It had
      faded from my sight, had grown flat as a dogma, uninteresting as &ldquo;a foul
      and pestilent congregation of vapours;&rdquo; the moon had been but a round
      thing with the sun shining upon it, and the stars were only minding their
      own business. But now the solemn march towards an unseen, unimagined goal
      had again begun. Wynnie&rsquo;s life was hid with Christ in God. Away strode the
      cloudy pageant with its banners blowing in the wind, which blew where it
      grandly listed, marching as to a solemn triumphal music that drew them
      from afar towards the gates of pearl by which the morning walks out of the
      New Jerusalem to gladden the nations of the earth. Solitary stars, with
      all their sparkles drawn in, shone, quiet as human eyes, in the deep
      solemn clefts of dark blue air. They looked restrained and still, as if
      they knew all about it&mdash;all about the secret of this midnight march.
      For the moon&mdash;she saw the sun, and therefore made the earth glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been a moon to me this night, my wife,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You were
      looking full at the truth, while I was dark. I saw its light in your face,
      and believed, and turned my soul to the sun. And now I am both ashamed and
      glad. God keep me from sinning so again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear husband, it was only a mood&mdash;a passing mood,&rdquo; said Ethelwyn,
      seeking to comfort me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a mood, and thank God it is now past; but it was a wicked one. It
      was a mood in which the Lord might have called me a devil, as he did St.
      Peter. Such moods have to be grappled with and fought the moment they
      appear. They must not have their way for a single thought even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t help it always, can we, husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it out and out, because our wills are not yet free with the
      freedom God is giving us as fast as we will let him. When we are able to
      will thoroughly, then we shall do what we will. At least, I think we
      shall. But there is a mystery in it God only understands. All we know is,
      that we can struggle and pray. But a mood is an awful oppression sometimes
      when you least believe in it and most wish to get rid of it. It is like a
      headache in the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do the people do that don&rsquo;t believe in God?&rdquo; said Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same moment Wynnie, who had seen us pass the window, opened the door
      of the bark-house for us, and we passed into Connie&rsquo;s chamber and found
      her lying in the moonlight, gazing at the same heavens as her father and
      mother had been revelling in.

      CHAPTER II. OUR LAST SHORE-DINNER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day was very lovely. I think it is the last of the kind of which
      I shall have occasion to write in my narrative of the Seaboard Parish. I
      wonder if my readers are tired of so much about the common things of
      Nature. I reason about it something in this way: We are so easily affected
      by the smallest things that are of the unpleasant kind, that we ought to
      train ourselves to the influence of those that are of an opposite nature.
      The unpleasant ones are like the thorns which make themselves felt as we
      scramble&mdash;for we often do scramble in a very undignified manner&mdash;through
      the thickets of life; and, feeling the thorns, we grumble, and are blind
      to all but the thorns. The flowers, and the lovely leaves, and the red
      berries, and the clusters of filberts, and the birds&rsquo;-nests do not force
      themselves upon our attention as the thorns do, and the thorns make us
      forget to look for them. But a scratch would be forgotten&mdash;and that
      in mental hurts is often equivalent to a cure, for a forgotten scratch on
      the mind or heart will never fester&mdash;if we but allowed our being a
      moment&rsquo;s repose upon any of the quiet, waiting, unobtrusive beauties that
      lie around the half-trodden way, offering their gentle healing. And when I
      think how, not unfrequently, otherwise noble characters are anything but
      admirable when under the influence of trifling irritations, the very
      paltriness of which seems what the mind, which would at once rouse itself
      to a noble endurance of any mighty evil, is unable to endure, I would
      gladly help so with sweet antidotes to defeat the fly in the ointment of
      the apothecary that the whole pot shall send forth a pure savour. We ought
      for this to cultivate the friendships of little things. Beauty is one of
      the surest antidotes to vexation. Often when life looked dreary about me,
      from some real or fancied injustice or indignity, has a thought of truth
      been flashed into my mind from a flower, a shape of frost, or even a
      lingering shadow&mdash;not to mention such glories as angel-winged clouds,
      rainbows, stars, and sunrises. Therefore I hope that in my loving delay
      over such aspects of Nature as impressed themselves upon me in this most
      memorable part of my history I shall not prove wearisome to my reader, for
      therein I should utterly contravene my hope and intent in the recording of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day there was to be an unusually low tide, and we had reckoned on
      enlarging our acquaintance with the bed of the ocean&mdash;of knowing a
      few yards more of the millions of miles lapt in the mystery of waters. It
      was to be low water about two o&rsquo;clock, and we resolved to dine upon the
      sands. But all the morning the children were out playing on the threshold
      of old Neptune&rsquo;s palace; for in his quieter mood he will, like a fierce
      mastiff, let children do with him what they will. I gave myself a whole
      holiday&mdash;sometimes the most precious part of my life both for myself
      and those for whom I labour&mdash;and wandered about on the shore, now
      passing the children, and assailed with a volley of cries and entreaties
      to look at this one&rsquo;s castle and that one&rsquo;s ditch, now leaving them
      behind, with what in its ungraduated flatness might well enough personate
      an endless desert of sand between, over the expanse of which I could
      imagine them disappearing on a far horizon, whence however a faint
      occasional cry of excitement and pleasure would reach my ears. The sea was
      so calm, and the shore so gently sloping, that you could hardly tell where
      the sand ceased and the sea began&mdash;the water sloped to such a thin
      pellicle, thinner than any knife-edge, upon the shining brown sand, and
      you saw the sand underneath the water to such a distance out. Yet this
      depth, which would not drown a red spider, was the ocean. In my mind I
      followed that bed of shining sand, bared of its hiding waters, out and
      out, till I was lost in an awful wilderness of chasms, precipices, and
      mountain-peaks, in whose caverns the sea-serpent may dwell, with his
      breath of pestilence; the kraken, with &ldquo;his skaly rind,&rdquo; may there be
      sleeping
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His ancient dreamless, uninvaded sleep,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      while
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;faintest sunlights flee
  About his shadowy sides,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      as he lies
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There may lie all the horrors that Schiller&rsquo;s diver encountered&mdash;the
      frightful Molch, and that worst of all, to which he gives no name, which
      came creeping with a hundred knots at once; but here are only the gracious
      rainbow-woven shells, an evanescent jelly or two, and the queer baby-crabs
      that crawl out from the holes of the bordering rocks. What awful
      gradations of gentleness lead from such as these down to those cabins
      where wallow the inventions of Nature&rsquo;s infancy, when, like a child of
      untutored imagination, she drew on the slate of her fancy creations in
      which flitting shadows of beauty serve only to heighten the shuddering,
      gruesome horror. The sweet sun and air, the hand of man, and the growth of
      the ages, have all but swept such from the upper plains of the earth. What
      hunter&rsquo;s bow has twanged, what adventurer&rsquo;s rifle has cracked in those
      leagues of mountain-waste, vaster than all the upper world can show, where
      the beasts of the ocean &ldquo;graze the sea-weed, their pasture&rdquo;! Diana of the
      silver bow herself, when she descends into the interlunar caves of hell,
      sends no such monsters fleeing from her spells. Yet if such there be, such
      horrors too must lie in the undiscovered caves of man&rsquo;s nature, of which
      all this outer world is but a typical analysis. By equally slow gradations
      may the inner eye descend from the truth of a Cordelia to the falsehood of
      an Iago. As these golden sands slope from the sunlight into the wallowing
      abyss of darkness, even so from the love of the child to his holy mother
      slopes the inclined plane of humanity to the hell of the sensualist. &ldquo;But
      with one difference in the moral world,&rdquo; I said aloud, as I paced up and
      down on the shimmering margin, &ldquo;that everywhere in the scale the eye of
      the all-seeing Father can detect the first quiver of the eyelid that would
      raise itself heavenward, responsive to his waking spirit.&rdquo; I lifted my
      eyes in the relief of the thought, and saw how the sun of the autumn hung
      above the waters oppressed with a mist of his own glory; far away to the
      left a man who had been clambering on a low rock, inaccessible save in
      such a tide, gathering mussels, threw himself into the sea and swam
      ashore; above his head the storm-tower stood in the stormless air; the sea
      glittered and shone, and the long-winged birds knew not which to choose,
      the balmy air or the cool deep, now flitting like arrow-heads through the
      one, now alighting eagerly upon the other, to forsake it anew for the
      thinner element. I thanked God for his glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa, it&rsquo;s so jolly&mdash;so jolly!&rdquo; shouted the children as I passed
      them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that&rsquo;s so jolly, Charlie?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My castle,&rdquo; screeched Harry in reply; &ldquo;only it&rsquo;s tumbled down. The water
      <i>would</i> keep coming in underneath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to stop it with a newspaper,&rdquo; cried Charlie, &ldquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t. So
      we were forced to let it be, and down it went into the ditch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We blew it up rather than surrender,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;We did; only Harry
      always forgets, and says it was the water did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew near the rock that held the bath. I had never approached it from
      this side before. It was high above my head, and a stream of water was
      flowing from it. I scrambled up, undressed, and plunged into its dark
      hollow, where I felt like one of the sea-beasts of which I had been
      dreaming, down in the caves of the unvisited ocean. But the sun was over
      my head, and the air with an edge of the winter was about me. I dressed
      quickly, descended on the other side of the rock, and wandered again on
      the sands to seaward of the breakwater, which lay above, looking dry and
      weary, and worn with years of contest with the waves, which had at length
      withdrawn defeated to their own country, and left it as if to victory and
      a useless age of peace. How different was the scene when a raving mountain
      of water filled all the hollow where I now wandered, and rushed over the
      top of that mole now so high above me; and I had to cling to its stones to
      keep me from being carried off like a bit of floating sea-weed! This was
      the loveliest and strangest part of the shore. Several long low ridges of
      rock, of whose existence I scarcely knew, worn to a level with the sand,
      hollowed and channelled with the terrible run of the tide across them, and
      looking like the old and outworn cheek-teeth of some awful beast of prey,
      stretched out seawards. Here and there amongst them rose a well-known
      rock, but now so changed in look by being lifted all the height between
      the base on the waters, and the second base in the sand, that I wondered
      at each, walking round and viewing it on all sides. It seemed almost a
      fresh growth out of the garden of the shore, with uncouth hollows around
      its fungous root, and a forsaken air about its brows as it stood in the
      dry sand and looked seaward. But what made the chief delight of the spot,
      closed in by rocks from the open sands, was the multitude of fairy rivers
      that flowed across it to the sea. The gladness these streams gave me I
      cannot communicate. The tide had filled thousands of hollows in the
      breakwater, hundreds of cracked basins in the rocks, huge sponges of sand;
      from all of which&mdash;from cranny and crack, and oozing sponge&mdash;the
      water flowed in restricted haste back, back to the sea, tumbling in tiny
      cataracts down the faces of the rocks, bubbling from their roots as from
      wells, gathering in tanks of sand, and overflowing in broad shallow
      streams, curving and sweeping in their sandy channels, just like, the
      great rivers of a continent;&mdash;here spreading into smooth silent lakes
      and reaches, here babbling along in ripples and waves innumerable&mdash;flowing,
      flowing, to lose their small beings in the same ocean that met on the
      other side the waters of the Mississippi, the Orinoco, the Amazon. All
      their channels were of golden sand, and the golden sunlight was above and
      through and in them all: gold and gold met, with the waters between. And
      what gave an added life to their motion was, that all the ripples made
      shadows on the clear yellow below them. The eye could not see the rippling
      on the surface; but the sun saw it, and drew it in multitudinous shadowy
      motion upon the sand, with the play of a thousand fancies of gold
      burnished and dead, of sunlight and yellow, trembling, melting, curving,
      blending, vanishing ever, ever renewed. It was as if all the water-marks
      upon a web of golden silk had been set in wildest yet most graceful
      curvilinear motion by the breath of a hundred playful zephyrs. My eye
      could not be filled with seeing. I stood in speechless delight for a
      while, gazing at the &ldquo;endless ending&rdquo; which was &ldquo;the humour of the game,&rdquo;
       and thinking how in all God&rsquo;s works the laws of beauty are wrought out in
      evanishment, in birth and death. There, there is no hoarding, but an
      ever-fresh creating, an eternal flow of life from the heart of the
      All-beautiful. Hence even the heart of man cannot hoard. His brain or his
      hand may gather into its box and hoard; but the moment the thing has
      passed into the box, the heart has lost it and is hungry again. If man
      would <i>have,</i> it is the giver he must have; the eternal, the
      original, the ever-outpouring is alone within his reach; the everlasting
      <i>creation</i> is his heritage. Therefore all that he makes must be free
      to come and go through the heart of his child; he can enjoy it only as it
      passes, can enjoy only its life, its soul, its vision, its meaning, not
      itself. To hoard rubies and sapphires is as useless and hopeless for the
      heart, as if I were to attempt to hoard this marvel of sand and water and
      sunlight in the same iron chest with the musty deeds of my wife&rsquo;s
      inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; I murmured half aloud, &ldquo;thou alone art, and I am because thou
      art. Thy will shall be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know that I must have spoken aloud, because I remember the start of
      consciousness and discomposure occasioned by the voice of Percivale
      greeting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I did not mean to startle you, Mr. Walton.
      I thought you were only looking at Nature&rsquo;s childplay&mdash;not thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know few things <i>more</i> fit to set one thinking than what you have
      very well called Nature&rsquo;s childplay,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Is Nature very
      heartless now, do you think, to go on with this kind of thing at our feet,
      when away up yonder lies the awful London, with so many sores festering in
      her heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must answer your own question, Mr. Walton. You know I cannot. I
      confess I feel the difficulty deeply. I will go further, and confess that
      the discrepancy makes me doubt many things I would gladly believe. I know
      <i>you</i> are able to distinguish between a glad unbelief and a sorrowful
      doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Else were I unworthy of the humblest place in the kingdom&mdash;unworthy
      to be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,&rdquo; I answered, and recoiled from
      the sound of my own words; for they seemed to imply that I believed myself
      worthy of the position I occupied. I hastened to correct them: &ldquo;But do not
      mistake my thoughts,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I do not dream of worthiness in the way of
      honour&mdash;only of fitness for the work to be done. For that I think God
      has fitted me in some measure. The doorkeeper&rsquo;s office may be given him,
      not because he has done some great deed worthy of the honour, but because
      he can sweep the porch and scour the threshold, and will, in the main, try
      to keep them clean. That is all the worthiness I dare to claim, even to
      hope that I possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one who knows you can mistake your words, except wilfully,&rdquo; returned
      Percivale courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now I will just ask you, in reference to the
      contrast between human life and nature, how you will go back to your work
      in London, after seeing all this child&rsquo;s and other play of Nature? Suppose
      you had had nothing here but rain and high winds and sea-fogs, would you
      have been better fitted for doing something to comfort those who know
      nothing of such influences than you will be now? One of the most important
      qualifications of a sick-nurse is a ready smile. A long-faced nurse in a
      sickroom is a visible embodiment and presence of the disease against which
      the eager life of the patient is fighting in agony. Such ought to be
      banished, with their black dresses and their mourning-shop looks, from
      every sick-chamber, and permitted to minister only to the dead, who do not
      mind looks. With what a power of life and hope does a woman&mdash;young or
      old I do not care&mdash;with a face of the morning, a dress like the
      spring, a bunch of wild flowers in her hand, with the dew upon them, and
      perhaps in her eyes too (I don&rsquo;t object to that&mdash;that is sympathy,
      not the worship of darkness),&mdash;with what a message from nature and
      life does she, looking death in the face with a smile, dawn upon the
      vision of the invalid! She brings a little health, a little strength to
      fight, a little hope to endure, actually lapt in the folds of her gracious
      garments; for the soul itself can do more than any medicine, if it be fed
      with the truth of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you not&mdash;I beg your pardon for interposing on your eloquence
      with dull objection,&rdquo; said Percivale&mdash;&ldquo;are you not begging all the
      question? <i>Is</i> life such an affair of sunshine and gladness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If life is not, then I confess all this show of nature is worse than
      vanity&mdash;it is a vile mockery. Life is gladness; it is the death in it
      that makes the misery. We call life-in-death life, and hence the mistake.
      If gladness were not at the root, whence its opposite sorrow, against
      which we arise, from which we recoil, with which we fight? We recognise it
      as death&mdash;the contrary of life. There could be no sorrow but for a
      recognition of primordial bliss. This in us that fights must be life. It
      is of the nature of light, not of darkness; darkness is nothing until the
      light comes. This very childplay, as you call it, of Nature, is her
      assertion of the secret that life is the deepest, that life shall conquer
      death. Those who believe this must bear the good news to them that sit in
      darkness and the shadow of death. Our Lord has conquered death&mdash;yea,
      the moral death that he called the world; and now, having sown the seed of
      light, the harvest is springing in human hearts, is springing in this
      dance of radiance, and will grow and grow until the hearts of the children
      of the kingdom shall frolic in the sunlight of the Father&rsquo;s presence.
      Nature has God at her heart; she is but the garment of the Invisible. God
      wears his singing robes in a day like this, and says to his children, &lsquo;Be
      not afraid: your brothers and sisters up there in London are in my hands;
      go and help them. I am with you. Bear to them the message of joy. Tell
      them to be of good cheer: I have overcome the world. Tell them to endure
      hunger, and not sin; to endure passion, and not yield; to admire, and not
      desire. Sorrow and pain are serving my ends; for by them will I slay sin;
      and save my children.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could believe as you do, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could. But God will teach you, if you are willing to be
      taught.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire the truth, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you! God is blessing you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; returned Percivale devoutly; and we strolled away together in
      silence towards the cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recession of the tide allowed us to get far enough away from the face
      of the rocks to see the general effect. With the lisping of the inch-deep
      wavelets at our heels we stood and regarded the worn yet defiant, the
      wasted and jagged yet reposeful face of the guardians of the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who could imagine, in weather like this, and with this baby of a tide
      lying behind us, low at our feet, and shallow as the water a schoolboy
      pours upon his slate to wash it withal, that those grand cliffs before us
      bear on their front the scars and dints of centuries, of chiliads of
      stubborn resistance, of passionate contest with this same creature that is
      at this moment unable to rock the cradle of an infant? Look behind you, at
      your feet, Mr. Percivale; look before you at the chasms, rents, caves, and
      hollows of those rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were a painter, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;At least I know I should rejoice in it, if
      it had been given me to be one. But why do you say so now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you have always some individual predominating idea, which would
      give interpretation to Nature while it gave harmony, reality, and
      individuality to your representation of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but I have no gift whatever in that
      direction. I have no idea of drawing, or of producing the effects of light
      and shade; though I think I have a little notion of colour&mdash;perhaps
      about as much as the little London boy, who stopped a friend of mine once
      to ask the way to the field where the buttercups grew, had of nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could ask your opinion of some of my pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I should never presume to give. I could only tell you what they made
      me feel, or perhaps only think. Some day I may have the pleasure of
      looking at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I offer you my address?&rdquo; he said, and took a card from his
      pocket-book. &ldquo;It is a poor place, but if you should happen to think of me
      when you are next in London, I shall be honoured by your paying me a
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy,&rdquo; I returned, taking his card.&mdash;&ldquo;Did it ever
      occur to you, in reference to the subject we were upon a few minutes ago,
      how little you can do without shadow in making a picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little indeed,&rdquo; answered Percivale. &ldquo;In fact, it would be no picture at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if the world would fare better without its shadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be a poor satisfaction, with regard to the nature of God, to
      be told that he allowed evil for artistic purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would indeed, if you regard the world as a picture. But if you think
      of his art as expended, not upon the making of a history or a drama, but
      upon the making of an individual, a being, a character, then I think a
      great part of the difficulty concerning the existence of evil which
      oppresses you will vanish. So long as a creature has not sinned, sin is
      possible to him. Does it seem inconsistent with the character of God that
      in order that sin should become impossible he should allow sin to come?
      that, in order that his creatures should choose the good and refuse the
      evil, in order that they might become such, with their whole nature
      infinitely enlarged, as to turn from sin with a perfect repugnance of the
      will, he should allow them to fall? that, in order that, from being sweet
      childish children, they should become noble, child-like men and women, he
      should let them try to walk alone? Why should he not allow the possible in
      order that it should become impossible? for possible it would ever have
      been, even in the midst of all the blessedness, until it had been, and had
      been thus destroyed. Thus sin is slain, uprooted. And the war must ever
      exist, it seems to me, where there is creation still going on. How could I
      be content to guard my children so that they should never have temptation,
      knowing that in all probability they would fail if at any moment it should
      cross their path? Would the deepest communion of father and child ever be
      possible between us? Evil would ever seem to be in the child, so long as
      it was possible it should be there developed. And if this can be said for
      the existence of moral evil, the existence of all other evil becomes a
      comparative trifle; nay, a positive good, for by this the other is
      combated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand you,&rdquo; returned Percivale. &ldquo;I will think over what
      you have said. These are very difficult questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. I don&rsquo;t think argument is of much use about them, except as it may
      help to quiet a man&rsquo;s uneasiness a little, and so give his mind peace to
      think about duty. For about the doing of duty there can be no question,
      once it is seen. And the doing of duty is the shortest&mdash;in very fact,
      the only way into the light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we spoke, we had turned from the cliffs, and wandered back across the
      salt streams to the sands beyond. From the direction of the house came a
      little procession of servants, with Walter at their head, bearing the
      preparations for our dinner&mdash;over the gates of the lock, down the
      sides of the embankment of the canal, and across the sands, in the
      direction of the children, who were still playing merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you join our early dinner, which is to be out of doors, as you see,
      somewhere hereabout on the sands?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if you will let me be of some use
      first. I presume you mean to bring your invalid out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and you shall help me to carry her, if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I hoped,&rdquo; said Percivale; and we went together towards the
      parsonage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached, I saw Wynnie sitting at the drawing-room window; but
      when we entered the room, she was gone. My wife was there, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Wynnie?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She saw you coming,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and went to get Connie ready; for I
      guessed Mr. Percivale had come to help you to carry her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I could not help doubting there might be more than that in Wynnie&rsquo;s
      disappearance. &ldquo;What if she should have fallen in love with him,&rdquo; I
      thought, &ldquo;and he should never say a word on the subject? That would be
      dreadful for us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been repeatedly but not very much together of late, and I was
      compelled to allow to myself that if they did fall in love with each other
      it would be very natural on both sides, for there was evidently a great
      mental resemblance between them, so that they could not help sympathising
      with each other&rsquo;s peculiarities. And anyone could see what a fine couple
      they would make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie was much taller than Connie&mdash;almost the height of her mother.
      She had a very fair skin, and brown hair, a broad forehead, a wise,
      thoughtful, often troubled face, a mouth that seldom smiled, but on which
      a smile seemed always asleep, and round soft cheeks that dimpled like
      water when she did smile. I have described Percivale before. Why should
      not two such walk together along the path to the gates of the light? And
      yet I could not help some anxiety. I did not know anything of his history.
      I had no testimony concerning him from anyone that knew him. His past life
      was a blank to me; his means of livelihood probably insufficient&mdash;certainly,
      I judged, precarious; and his position in society&mdash;but there I
      checked myself: I had had enough of that kind of thing already. I would
      not willingly offend in that worldliness again. The God of the whole earth
      could not choose that I should look at such works of his hands after that
      fashion. And I was his servant&mdash;not Mammon&rsquo;s or Belial&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this passed through my mind in about three turns of the winnowing-fan
      of thought. Mr. Percivale had begun talking to my wife, who took no pains
      to conceal that his presence was pleasant to her, and I went upstairs,
      almost unconsciously, to Connie&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I opened the door, forgetting to announce my approach as I ought to
      have done, I saw Wynnie leaning over Connie, and Connie&rsquo;s arm round her
      waist. Wynnie started back, and Connie gave a little cry, for the jerk
      thus occasioned had hurt her. Wynnie had turned her head away, but turned
      it again at Connie&rsquo;s cry, and I saw a tear on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darlings, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It was very stupid of me not to
      knock at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Connie looked up at me with large resting eyes, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, papa, Wynnie is in one of her gloomy moods, and didn&rsquo;t want
      you to see her crying. She gave me a little pull, that was all. It didn&rsquo;t
      hurt me much, only I&rsquo;m such a goose! I&rsquo;m in terror before the pain comes.
      Look at me,&rdquo; she added, seeing, doubtless, some perturbation on my
      countenance, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now.&rdquo; And she smiled in my face perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Wynnie, put my arm about her, kissed her cheek, and left the
      room. I looked round at the door, and saw that Connie was following me
      with her eyes, but Wynnie&rsquo;s were hidden in her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to the drawing-room, and in a few minutes Walter came to
      announce that dinner was about to be served. The same moment Wynnie came
      to say that Connie was ready. She did not lift her eyes, or approach to
      give Percivale any greeting, but went again as soon as she had given her
      message. I saw that he looked first concerned and then thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Mr. Percivale,&rdquo; I said; and he followed me up to Connie&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie was not there; but Connie lay, looking lovely, all ready for going.
      We lifted her, and carried her by the window out on the down, for the
      easiest way, though the longest, was by the path to the breakwater, along
      its broad back and down from the end of it upon the sands. Before we
      reached the breakwater, I found that Wynnie was following behind us. We
      stopped in the middle of it, and set Connie down, as if I wanted to take
      breath. But I had thought of something to say to her, which I wanted
      Wynnie to hear without its being addressed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see, Connie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how far off the water is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa; it is a long way off. I wish I could get up and run down to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly believe that all between, all those rocks, and all that
      sand, will be covered before sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it will be. But it doesn&rsquo;t <i>look</i> likely, does it, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least likely, my dear. Do you remember that stormy night when I
      came through your room to go out for a walk in the dark?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember it, papa? I cannot forget it. Every time I hear the wind blowing
      when I wake in the night I fancy you are out in it, and have to wake
      myself up&rsquo; quite to get rid of the thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Connie, look down into the great hollow there, with rocks and sand
      at the bottom of it, stretching far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look over the side of your litter. You see those holes all about
      between the stones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one of those little holes saved my life that night, when the great
      gulf there was full of huge mounds of roaring water, which rushed across
      this breakwater with force enough to sweep a whole cavalry regiment off
      its back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Connie, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then first I told her all the story. And Wynnie listened behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I <i>was</i> right in being frightened, papa!&rdquo; cried Connie,
      bursting into tears; for since her accident she could not well command her
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right in trusting in God, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you might have been drowned, papa!&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has a right to say that anything might have been other than what
      has been. Before a thing has happened we can say might or might not; but
      that has to do only with our ignorance. Of course I am not speaking of
      things wherein we ought to exercise will and choice. That is <i>our</i>
      department. But this does not look like that now, does it? Think what a
      change&mdash;from the dark night and the roaring water to this fulness of
      sunlight and the bare sands, with the water lisping on their edge away
      there in the distance. Now, I want you to think that in life troubles will
      come which look as if they would never pass away; the night and the storm
      look as if they would last for ever; but the calm and the morning cannot
      be stayed; the storm in its very nature is transient. The effort of
      Nature, as that of the human heart, ever is to return to its repose, for
      God is Peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you will excuse me, Mr. Walton,&rdquo; said Percivale, &ldquo;you can hardly
      expect experience to be of use to any but those who have had it. It seems
      to me that its influences cannot be imparted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on the amount of faith in those to whom its results are
      offered. Of course, as experience, it can have no weight with another; for
      it is no longer experience. One remove, and it ceases. But faith in the
      person who has experienced can draw over or derive&mdash;to use an old
      Italian word&mdash;some of its benefits to him who has the faith.
      Experience may thus, in a sense, be accumulated, and we may go on to fresh
      experience of our own. At least I can hope that the experience of a father
      may take the form of hope in the minds of his daughters. Hope never hurt
      anyone, never yet interfered with duty; nay, always strengthens to the
      performance of duty, gives courage, and clears the judgment. St. Paul says
      we are saved by hope. Hope is the most rational thing in the universe.
      Even the ancient poets, who believed it was delusive, yet regarded it as
      an antidote given by the mercy of the gods against some, at least, of the
      ills of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they counted it delusive. A wise man cannot consent to be deluded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly not. The sorest truth rather than a false hope! But what is a
      false hope? Only one that ought not to be fulfilled. The old poets could
      give themselves little room for hope, and less for its fulfilment; for
      what were the gods in whom they believed&mdash;I cannot say in whom they
      trusted? Gods who did the best their own poverty of being was capable of
      doing for men when they gave them the <i>illusion</i> of hope. But I see
      they are waiting for us below. One thing I repeat&mdash;the waves that
      foamed across the spot where we now stand are gone away, have sunk and
      vanished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will come again, papa,&rdquo; faltered Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And God will come with them, my love,&rdquo; I said, as we lifted the litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more we were all seated on the sand around a table-cloth
      spread upon it. I shall never forgot the peace and the light outside and
      in, as far as I was concerned at least, and I hope the others too, that
      afternoon. The tide had turned, and the waves were creeping up over the
      level, soundless almost as thought; but it would be time to go home long
      before they had reached us. The sun was in the western half of the sky,
      and now and then a breath of wind came from the sea, with a slight
      saw-edge in it, but not enough to hurt. Connie could stand much more in
      that way now. And when I saw how she could move herself on her couch, and
      thought how much she had improved since first she was laid upon it, hope
      for her kept fluttering joyously in my heart. I could not help fancying
      even that I saw her move her legs a little; but I could not be in the
      least sure; and she, if she did move them, was clearly unconscious of it.
      Charles and Harry were every now and then starting up from their dinner
      and running off with a shout, to return with apparently increased appetite
      for the rest of it; and neither their mother nor I cared to interfere with
      the indecorum. Dora alone took it upon her to rebuke them. Wynnie was very
      silent, but looked more cheerful. Connie seemed full of quiet bliss. My
      wife&rsquo;s face was a picture of heavenly repose. The old nurse was walking
      about with the baby, occasionally with one hand helping the other servants
      to wait upon us. They, too, seemed to have a share in the gladness of the
      hour, and, like Ariel, did their spiriting gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the will of God,&rdquo; I said, after the things were removed, and we
      had sat for a few moments in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the will of God, husband?&rdquo; asked Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this, my love,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;this living air, and wind, and sea, and
      light, and land all about us; this consenting, consorting harmony of
      Nature, that mirrors a like peace in our souls. The perfection of such
      visions, the gathering of them all in one was, is, I should say, in the
      face of Christ Jesus. You will say that face was troubled sometimes. Yes,
      but with a trouble that broke not the music, but deepened the harmony.
      When he wept at the grave of Lazarus, you do not think it was for Lazarus
      himself, or for his own loss of him, that he wept? That could not be,
      seeing he had the power to call him back when he would. The grief was for
      the poor troubled hearts left behind, to whom it was so dreadful because
      they had not faith enough in his Father, the God of life and love, who was
      looking after it all, full of tenderness and grace, with whom Lazarus was
      present and blessed. It was the aching, loving heart of humanity for which
      he wept, that needed God so awfully, and could not yet trust in him. Their
      brother was only hidden in the skirts of their Father&rsquo;s garment, but they
      could not believe that: they said he was dead&mdash;lost&mdash;away&mdash;all
      gone, as the children say. And it was so sad to think of a whole world
      full of the grief of death, that he could not bear it without the human
      tears to help his heart, as they help ours. It was for our dark sorrows
      that he wept. But the peace could be no less plain on the face that saw
      God. Did you ever think of that wonderful saying: &lsquo;Again a little while,
      and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father&rsquo;? The heart of man would
      have joined the &lsquo;because I go to the Father&rsquo; with the former result&mdash;the
      not seeing of him. The heart of man is not able, without more and more
      light, to understand that all vision is in the light of the Father.
      Because Jesus went to the Father, therefore the disciples saw him tenfold
      more. His body no longer in their eyes, his very being, his very self was
      in their hearts&mdash;not in their affections only&mdash;in their spirits,
      their heavenly consciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I said this, a certain hymn, for which I had and have an especial
      affection, came into my mind, and, without prologue or introduction, I
      repeated it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;If I Him but have,
    If he be but mine,
      If my heart, hence to the grave,
    Ne&rsquo;er forgets his love divine&mdash;
  Know I nought of sadness,
  Feel I nought but worship, love, and gladness.

      If I Him but have,
    Glad with all I part;
      Follow on my pilgrim staff
    My Lord only, with true heart;
  Leave them, nothing saying,
  On broad, bright, and crowded highways straying.

        If I Him but have,
      Glad I fall asleep;
        Aye the flood that his heart gave
      Strength within my heart shall keep,
  And with soft compelling
  Make it tender, through and through it swelling.

        If I Him but have,
      Mine the world I hail!
        Glad as cherub smiling grave,
      Holding back the virgin&rsquo;s veil.
  Sunk and lost in seeing,
  Earthly fears have died from all my being.

        Where I have but Him
      Is my Fatherland;
        And all gifts and graces come
      Heritage into my hand:
  Brothers long deplored
  I in his disciples find restored.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely hymn, papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Connie. She could always speak more
      easily than either her mother or sister. &ldquo;Who wrote it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friedrich von Hardenberg, known, where he is known, as Novalis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must have written it in German. Did you translate it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You will find, I think, that I have kept form, thought, and feeling,
      however I may have failed in making an English poem of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you dear papa, it is lovely! Is it long since you did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years before you were born, Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of you having lived so long, and being one of us!&rdquo; she returned.
      &ldquo;Was he a Roman Catholic, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was a Moravian. At least, his parents were. I don&rsquo;t think he
      belonged to any section of the church in particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oughtn&rsquo;t he, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, my dear, except he saw good reason for it. But what is the
      use of asking such questions, after a hymn like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I didn&rsquo;t think anything bad, papa, I assure you. It was only that I
      wanted to know more about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were in her eyes, and I was sorry I had treated as significant
      what was really not so. But the constant tendency to consider Christianity
      as associated of necessity with this or that form of it, instead of as
      simply obedience to Christ, had grown more and more repulsive to me as I
      had grown myself, for it always seemed like an insult to my brethren in
      Christ; hence the least hint of it in my children I was too ready to be
      down upon like a most unchristian ogre. I took her hand in mine, and she
      was comforted, for she saw in my face that I was sorry, and yet she could
      see that there was reason at the root of my haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Wynnie, who, I thought afterwards, must have strengthened
      herself to speak from the instinctive desire to show Percivale how far she
      was from being out of sympathy with what he might suppose formed a barrier
      between him and me&mdash;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the lovely feeling in that poem
      seems to me, as in all the rest of such poems, to belong only to the New
      Testament, and have nothing to do with this world round about us. These
      things look as if they were only for drawing and painting and being glad
      in, not as if they had relations with all those awful and solemn things.
      As soon as I try to get the two together, I lose both of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because the human mind must begin with one thing and grow to the
      rest. At first, Christianity seemed to men to have only to do with their
      conscience. That was the first relation, of course. But even with art it
      was regarded as having no relation except for the presentment of its
      history. Afterwards, men forgot the conscience almost in trying to make
      Christianity comprehensible to the understanding. Now, I trust, we are
      beginning to see that Christianity is everything or nothing. Either the
      whole is a lovely fable setting forth the loftiest longing of the human
      soul after the vision of the divine, or it is such a fact as is the heart
      not only of theology so called, but of history, politics, science, and
      art. The treasures of the Godhead must be hidden in him, and therefore by
      him only can be revealed. This will interpret all things, or it has not
      yet been. Teachers of men have not taught this, because they have not seen
      it. If we do not find him in nature, we may conclude either that we do not
      understand the expression of nature, or have mistaken ideas or poor
      feelings about him. It is one great business in our life to find the
      interpretation which will render this harmony visible. Till we find it, we
      have not seen him to be all in all. Recognising a discord when they
      touched the notes of nature and society, the hermits forsook the
      instrument altogether, and contented themselves with a partial symphony&mdash;lofty,
      narrow, and weak. Their example, more or less, has been followed by almost
      all Christians. Exclusion is so much the easier way of getting harmony in
      the orchestra than study, insight, and interpretation, that most have
      adopted it. It is for us, and all who have hope in the infinite God, to
      widen its basis as we may, to search and find the true tone and right
      idea, place, and combination of instruments, until to our enraptured ear
      they all, with one voice of multiform yet harmonious utterance, declare
      the glory of God and of his Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grand idea,&rdquo; said Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore likely to be a true one,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;People find it hard to
      believe grand things; but why? If there be a God, is it not likely
      everything is grand, save where the reflection of his great thoughts is
      shaken, broken, distorted by the watery mirrors of our unbelieving and
      troubled souls? Things ought to be grand, simple, and noble. The ages of
      eternity will go on showing that such they are and ever have been. God
      will yet be victorious over our wretched unbeliefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sitting facing the sea, but with my eyes fixed on the sand, boring
      holes in it with my stick, for I could talk better when I did not look my
      familiar faces in the face. I did not feel thus in the pulpit; there I
      sought the faces of my flock, to assist me in speaking to their needs. As
      I drew to the close of my last monologue, a colder and stronger blast from
      the sea blew in my face. I lifted my head, and saw that the tide had crept
      up a long way, and was coming in fast. A luminous fog had sunk down over
      the western horizon, and almost hidden the sun, had obscured the half of
      the sea, and destroyed all our hopes of a sunset. A certain veil as of the
      commonplace, like that which so often settles down over the spirit of man
      after a season of vision and glory and gladness, had dropped over the face
      of Nature. The wind came in little bitter gusts across the dull waters. It
      was time to lift Connie and take her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the last time we ate together on the open shore.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. A PASTORAL VISIT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning rose neither &ldquo;cherchef&rsquo;t in a comely cloud&rdquo; nor &ldquo;roab&rsquo;d
      in flames and amber light,&rdquo; but covered all in a rainy mist, which the
      wind mingled with salt spray torn from the tops of the waves. Every now
      and then the wind blew a blastful of larger drops against the window of my
      study with an angry clatter and clash, as if daring me to go out and meet
      its ire. The earth was very dreary, for there were no shadows anywhere.
      The sun was hustled away by the crowding vapours; and earth, sea, and sky
      were possessed by a gray spirit that threatened wrath. The breakfast-bell
      rang, and I went down, expecting to find my Wynnie, who was always down
      first to make the tea, standing at the window with a sad face, giving fit
      response to the aspect of nature without, her soul talking with the gray
      spirit. I did find her at the window, looking out upon the restless
      tossing of the waters, but with no despondent answer to the trouble of
      nature. On the contrary, her cheek, though neither rosy nor radiant,
      looked luminous, and her eyes were flashing out upon the ebb-tide which
      was sinking away into the troubled ocean beyond. Does my girl-reader
      expect me to tell her next that something had happened? that Percivale had
      said something to her? or that, at least, he had just passed the window,
      and given her a look which she might interpret as she pleased? I must
      disappoint her. It was nothing of the sort. I knew the heart and feeling
      of my child. It was only that kind nature was in sympathy with her mood.
      The girl was always more peaceful in storm than in sunshine. I remembered
      that now. A movement of life instantly began in her when the obligation of
      gladness had departed with the light. Her own being arose to provide for
      its own needs. She could smile now when nature required from her no smile
      in response to hers. And I could not help saying to myself, &ldquo;She must
      marry a poor man some day; she is a creature of the north, and not of the
      south; the hot sun of prosperity would wither her up. Give her a bleak
      hill-side, and a glint or two of sunshine between the hailstorms, and she
      will live and grow; give her poverty and love, and life will be
      interesting to her as a romance; give her money and position, and she will
      grow dull and haughty. She will believe in nothing that poet can sing or
      architect build. She will, like Cassius, scorn her spirit for being moved
      to smile at anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had stood regarding her for a moment. She turned and saw me, and came
      forward with her usual morning greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, papa: I thought it was Walter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see a smile on your face, my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me very disagreeable, papa. I know I am a trouble to you. But
      I am a trouble to myself first. I fear I have a discontented mind and a
      complaining temper. But I do try, and I will try hard to overcome it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not get the better of you, so long as you do the duty of the
      moment. But I think, as I told you before, that you are not very well, and
      that your indisposition is going to do you good by making you think about
      some things you are ready to think about, but which you might have
      banished if you had been in good health and spirits. You are feeling as
      you never felt before, that you need a presence in your soul of which at
      least you haven&rsquo;t enough yet. But I preached quite enough to you
      yesterday, and I won&rsquo;t go on the same way to-day again. Only I wanted to
      comfort you. Come and give me my breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do comfort me, papa,&rdquo; she answered, approaching the table. &ldquo;I know I
      don&rsquo;t show what I feel as I ought, but you do comfort me much. Don&rsquo;t you
      like a day like this, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, my dear. I always did. And I think you take after me in that, as
      you do in a good many things besides. That is how I understand you so
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I really take after you, papa? Are you sure that you understand me so
      well?&rdquo; she asked, brightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I do,&rdquo; I returned, replying to her last question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than I do myself?&rdquo; she asked with an arch smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considerably, if I mistake not,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful! To think that I am understood even when I don&rsquo;t
      understand myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even if I am wrong, you are yet understood. The blessedness of life
      is that we can hide nothing from God. If we could hide anything from God,
      that hidden thing would by and by turn into a terrible disease. It is the
      sight of God that keeps and makes things clean. But as we are both, by
      mutual confession, fond of this kind of weather, what do you say to going
      out with me? I have to visit a sick woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Mrs. Coombes, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear. I did not hear she was ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I daresay it is nothing much. Only old nursey said yesterday she was
      in bed with a bad cold, or something of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call and inquire as we pass,&mdash;that is, if you are inclined to
      go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you put an <i>if</i> to that, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just had a message from that cottage that stands all alone on the
      corner of Mr. Barton&rsquo;s farm&mdash;over the cliff, you know&mdash;that the
      woman is ill, and would like to see me. So the sooner we start the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have done my breakfast in five minutes, papa. O, here&rsquo;s mamma!&mdash;Mamma,
      I&rsquo;m going out for a walk in the rain with papa. You won&rsquo;t mind, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will do you any harm, my dear. That&rsquo;s all I mind, you
      know. It was only once or twice when you were not well that I objected to
      it. I quite agree with your papa, that only lazy people are <i>glad</i> to
      stay in-doors when it rains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it does blow so delightfully!&rdquo; said Wynnie, as she left the room to
      put on her long cloak and her bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We called at the sexton&rsquo;s cottage, and found him sitting gloomily by the
      low window, looking seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your wife is not <i>very</i> poorly, Coombes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. She be very comfortable in bed. Bed&rsquo;s not a bad place to be in
      in such weather,&rdquo; he answered, turning again a dreary look towards the
      Atlantic. &ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a passion for comfort you have, Coombes! How does that come about,
      do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was made so, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure you were. God made you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sir. Who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose he likes making people comfortable if he makes people like
      to be comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It du look likely enough, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then when he takes it out of your hands, you mustn&rsquo;t think he doesn&rsquo;t
      look after the people you would make comfortable if you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must mind my work, you know, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, surely. And you mustn&rsquo;t want to take his out of his hands, and go
      grumbling as if you would do it so much better if he would only let you
      get <i>your</i> hand to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you be right, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must just go and have a look
      about, though. Here&rsquo;s Agnes. She&rsquo;ll tell you about mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his spade from the corner, and went out. He often brought his
      tools into the cottage. He had carved the handle of his spade all over
      with the names of the people he had buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your mother, Agnes, that I will call in the evening and see her, if
      she would like to see me. We are going now to see Mrs. Stokes. She is very
      poorly, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go through the churchyard, papa,&rdquo; said Wynnie, &ldquo;and see what the
      old man is doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear. It is only a few steps round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you humour the sexton&rsquo;s foolish fancy so much, papa? It is such
      nonsense! You taught us it was, surely, in your sermon about the
      resurrection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly, my dear. But it would be of no use to try to get it out
      of his head by any argument. He has a kind of craze in that direction. To
      get people&rsquo;s hearts right is of much more importance than convincing their
      judgments. Right judgment will follow. All such fixed ideas should be
      encountered from the deepest grounds of truth, and not from the outsides
      of their relations. Coombes has to be taught that God cares for the dead
      more than he does, and <i>therefore</i> it is unreasonable for him to be
      anxious about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the churchyard we found the old man kneeling on a grave
      before its headstone. It was a very old one, with a death&rsquo;s-head and
      cross-bones carved upon the top of it in very high relief. With his
      pocket-knife he was removing the lumps of green moss out of the hollows of
      the eyes of the carven skull. We did not interrupt him, but walked past
      with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw what he was doing, Wynnie? That reminds me of almost the only
      thing in Dante&rsquo;s grand poem that troubles me. I cannot think of it without
      a renewal of my concern, though I have no doubt he is as sorry now as I am
      that ever he could have written it. When, in the <i>Inferno,</i> he
      reaches the lowest region of torture, which is a solid lake of ice, he
      finds the lost plunged in it to various depths, some, if I remember
      rightly, entirely submerged, and visible only through the ice, transparent
      as crystal, like the insects found in amber. One man with his head only
      above the ice, appeals to him as condemned to the same punishment to take
      pity on him, and remove the lumps of frozen tears from his eyes, that he
      may weep a little before they freeze again and stop the relief once more.
      Dante says to him, &lsquo;Tell me who you are, and if I do not assist you, I
      deserve to lie at the bottom of the ice myself.&rsquo; The man tells him who he
      is, and explains to him one awful mystery of these regions. Then he says,
      &lsquo;Now stretch forth thy hand, and open my eyes.&rsquo; &lsquo;And,&rsquo; says Dante, I did
      not open them for him; and rudeness to him was courtesy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he promised, you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did; and yet he did not do it. Pity and truth had abandoned him
      together. One would think little of it comparatively, were it not that
      Dante is so full of tenderness and grand religion. It is very awful, and
      may teach us many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what made you think of that now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely what Coombes was about. The visual image was all. He was scooping
      the green moss out of the eyes of the death&rsquo;s-head on the gravestone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time we were on the top of the downs, and the wind was buffeting
      us, and every other minute assailing us with a blast of rain. Wynnie drew
      her cloak closer about her, bent her head towards the blast, and struggled
      on bravely by my side. No one who wants to enjoy a walk in the rain must
      carry an umbrella; it is pure folly. When we came to one of the stone
      fences, we cowered down by its side for a few moments to recover our
      breath, and then struggled on again. Anything like conversation was out of
      the question. At length we dropped into a hollow, which gave us a little
      repose. Down below the sea was dashing into the mouth of the glen, or
      coomb, as they call it there. On the opposite side of the hollow, the
      little house to which we were going stood up against the gray sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to doubt whether I ought to have brought you, Wynnie. It was
      thoughtless of me; I don&rsquo;t mean for your sake, but because your presence
      may be embarrassing in a small house; for probably the poor woman may
      prefer seeing me alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go back, papa. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t mind it a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you had better come on. I shall not be long with her, I daresay. We
      may find some place that you can wait in. Are you wet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only my cloak. I am as dry as a tortoise inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then. We shall soon be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the house I found that Wynnie would not be in the way. I
      left her seated by the kitchen-fire, and was shown into the room where
      Mrs. Stokes lay. I cannot say I perceived. But I guessed somehow, the
      moment I saw her that there was something upon her mind. She was a
      hard-featured woman, with a cold, troubled black eye that rolled
      restlessly about. She lay on her back, moving her head from side to side.
      When I entered she only looked at me, and turned her eyes away towards the
      wall. I approached the bedside, and seated myself by it. I always do so at
      once; for the patient feels more at rest than if you stand tall up before
      her. I laid my hand on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very ill, Mrs. Stokes?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very,&rdquo; she answered with a groan. &ldquo;It be come to the last with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, indeed, Mrs. Stokes. It&rsquo;s not come to the last with us, so
      long as we have a Father in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but it be with me. He can&rsquo;t take any notice of the like of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But indeed he does, whether you think it or not. He takes notice of every
      thought we think, and every deed we do, and every sin we commit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said the last words with emphasis, for I suspected something more than
      usual upon her conscience. She gave another groan, but made no reply. I
      therefore went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Father in heaven is not like some fathers on earth, who, so long as
      their children don&rsquo;t bother them, let them do anything they like. He will
      not have them do what is wrong. He loves them too much for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t look at me,&rdquo; she said half murmuring, half sighing it out, so
      that I could hardly, hear what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because he <i>is</i> looking at you that you are feeling
      uncomfortable,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He wants you to confess your sins. I don&rsquo;t
      mean to me, but to himself; though if you would like to tell me anything,
      and I can help you, I shall be <i>very</i> glad. You know Jesus Christ
      came to save us from our sins; and that&rsquo;s why we call him our Saviour. But
      he can&rsquo;t save us from our sins if we won&rsquo;t confess that we have any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I never said but what I be a great sinner, as well as other
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose that&rsquo;s confessing your sins?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I once knew a
      woman of very bad character, who allowed to me she was a great sinner; but
      when I said, &lsquo;Yes, you have done so and so,&rsquo; she would not allow one of
      those deeds to be worthy of being reckoned amongst her sins. When I asked
      her what great sins she had been guilty of, then, seeing these counted for
      nothing, I could get no more out of her than that she was a great sinner,
      like other people, as you have just been saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t be thinking I ha&rsquo; done anything of that sort,&rdquo; she said
      with wakening energy. &ldquo;No man or woman dare say I&rsquo;ve done anything to be
      ashamed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve committed no sins?&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;But why did you send for me?
      You must have something to say to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did send for you. It must ha&rsquo; been my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve no business here!&rdquo; I returned, rising. &ldquo;I
      thought you had sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned no answer. I hoped that by retiring I should set her
      thinking, and make her more willing to listen the next time I came. I
      think clergymen may do much harm by insisting when people are in a bad
      mood, as if they had everything to do, and the Spirit of God nothing at
      all. I bade her good-day, hoped she would be better soon, and returned to
      Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we walked home together, I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wynnie, I was right. It would not have done at all to take you into the
      sick-room. Mrs. Stokes had not sent for me herself, and rather resented my
      appearance. But I think she will send for me before many days are over.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE ART OF NATURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We had a week of hazy weather after this. I spent it chiefly in my study
      and in Connie&rsquo;s room. A world of mist hung over the sea; it refused to
      hold any communion with mortals. As if ill-tempered or unhappy, it folded
      itself in its mantle and lay still.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it thinking about? All Nature is so full of meaning, that we
      cannot help fancying sometimes that she knows her own meanings. She is
      busy with every human mood in turn&mdash;sometimes with ten of them at
      once&mdash;picturing our own inner world before us, that we may see,
      understand, develop, reform it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was turning over some such thought in my mind one morning, when Dora
      knocked at the door, saying that Mr. Percivale had called, and that mamma
      was busy, and would I mind if she brought him up to the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least, my dear,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I shall be very glad to see
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much of weather for your sacred craft, Percivale,&rdquo; I said as he
      entered. &ldquo;I suppose, if you were asked to make a sketch to-day, it would
      be much the same as if a stupid woman were to ask you to take her
      portrait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so bad as that,&rdquo; said Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely the human face is more than nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature is never stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman might be pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature is full of beauty in her worst moods; while the prettier such a
      woman, the more stupid she would look, and the more irksome you would feel
      the task; for you could not help making claims upon her which you would
      never think of making upon Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you are right. Such stupidity has a good deal to do with moral
      causes. You do not ever feel that Nature is to blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature is never ugly. She may be dull, sorrowful, troubled; she may be
      lost in tears and pallor, but she cannot be ugly. It is only when you rise
      into animal nature that you find ugliness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True in the main only; for no lines of absolute division can be drawn in
      nature. I have seen ugly flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant it; but they are exceptional; and none of them are without
      beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely not. The ugliest soul even is not without some beauty. But I grant
      you that the higher you rise the more is ugliness possible, just because
      the greater beauty is possible. There is no ugliness to equal in its
      repulsiveness the ugliness of a beautiful face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are thinking of returning to London now, there
      seems so little to be gained by remaining here. When this weather begins
      to show itself I could wish myself in my own parish; but I am sure the
      change, even through the winter, will be good for my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be going soon,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but it would be too bad to take
      offence at the old lady&rsquo;s first touch of temper. I mean to wait and see
      whether we shall not have a little bit of St. Martin&rsquo;s summer, as
      Shakspere calls it; after which, hail London, queen of smoke and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what?&rdquo; I asked, seeing he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And soap,&rsquo; I was fancying you would say; for you never will allow the
      worst of things, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, surely I will not. For one thing, the worst has never been seen by
      anybody yet. We have no experience to justify it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were chatting in this loose manner when Walter came to the door to tell
      me that a messenger had come from Mrs. Stokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to see him, and found her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife be very bad, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish you could come and see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she want to see me?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been more uncomfortable than ever since you was there last,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;has she said she would like to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it, sir,&rdquo; answered the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is you who want me to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but I be sure she do want to see you. I know her way, you see,
      sir. She never would say she wanted anything in her life; she would always
      leave you to find it out: so I got sharp at that, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then would she allow she had wanted it when you got it her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never, sir. She be peculiar&mdash;my wife; she always be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know that you have come to ask me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you courage to tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t courage to tell her,&rdquo; I resumed, &ldquo;I have nothing more to
      say. I can&rsquo;t go; or, rather, I will not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell her, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will tell her that I refused to come until she sent for me
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben&rsquo;t that rather hard on a dying woman, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my reasons. Except she send for me herself, the moment I go she
      will take refuge in the fact that she did not send for me. I know your
      wife&rsquo;s peculiarity too, Mr. Stokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>will</i> tell her, sir. It&rsquo;s time to speak my own mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. It was time long ago. When she sends for me, if it be in the
      middle of the night, I shall be with her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left me and I returned to Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinking before you came,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;about the relation of
      Nature to our inner world. You know I am quite ignorant of your art, but I
      often think about the truths that lie at the root of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am greatly obliged to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for talking about these things. I
      assure you it is of more service to me than any professional talk. I
      always think the professions should not herd together so much as they do;
      they want to be shone upon from other quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe we have all to help each other, Percivale. The sun himself
      could give us no light that would be of any service to us but for the
      reflective power of the airy particles through which he shines. But
      anything I know I have found out merely by foraging for my own
      necessities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what makes the result valuable,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Tell me what
      you were thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;how everyone likes to see his own thoughts
      set outside of him, that he may contemplate them <i>objectively,</i> as
      the philosophers call it. He likes to see the other side of them, as it
      were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is, of course, true; else, I suppose, there would be no art at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely. But that is not the aspect in which I was considering the
      question. Those who can so set them forth are artists; and however they
      may fail of effecting such a representation of their ideas as will satisfy
      themselves, they yet experience satisfaction in the measure in which they
      have succeeded. But there are many more men who cannot yet utter their
      ideas in any form. Mind, I do expect that, if they will only be good, they
      shall have this power some day; for I do think that many things we call
      differences in kind, may in God&rsquo;s grand scale prove to be only differences
      in degree. And indeed the artist&mdash;by artist, I mean, of course,
      architect, musician, painter, poet, sculptor&mdash;in many things requires
      it just as much as the most helpless and dumb of his brethren, seeing in
      proportion to the things that he can do, he is aware of the things he
      cannot do, the thoughts he cannot express. Hence arises the enthusiasm
      with which people hail the work of an artist; they rejoice, namely, in
      seeing their own thoughts, or feelings, or something like them, expressed;
      and hence it comes that of those who have money, some hang their walls
      with pictures of their own choice, others&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Percivale, interrupting; &ldquo;but most people, I
      fear, hang their walls with pictures of other people&rsquo;s choice, for they
      don&rsquo;t buy them at all till the artist has got a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. And yet there is a shadow of choice even there; for they
      won&rsquo;t at least buy what they dislike. And again the growth in popularity
      may be only what first attracted their attention&mdash;not determined
      their choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are others who only buy them for their value in the market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Of such is not the talk,&rsquo; as the Germans would say. In as far as your
      description applies, such are only tradesmen, and have no claim to be
      considered now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I beg your pardon for interrupting. I am punished more than I
      deserve, if you have lost your thread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have. Let me see. Yes. I was saying that people hang
      their walls with pictures of their choice; or provide music, &amp;c., of
      their choice. Let me keep to the pictures: their choice, consciously or
      unconsciously, is determined by some expression that these pictures give
      to what is in themselves&mdash;the buyers, I mean. They like to see their
      own feelings outside of themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there not another possible motive&mdash;that the pictures teach them
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, I venture to think, shows a higher moral condition than the other,
      but still partakes of the other; for it is only what is in us already that
      makes us able to lay hold of a lesson. It is there in the germ, else
      nothing from without would wake it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite see what all this has to do with Nature and her
      influences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One step more, and I shall arrive at it. You will admit that the pictures
      and objects of art of all kinds, with which a man adorns the house he has
      chosen or built to live in, have thenceforward not a little to do with the
      education of his tastes and feelings. Even when he is not aware of it,
      they are working upon him,&mdash;for good, if he has chosen what is good,
      which alone shall be our supposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; that is clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I come to it. God, knowing our needs, built our house for our needs&mdash;not
      as one man may build for another, but as no man can build for himself. For
      our comfort, education, training, he has put into form for us all the
      otherwise hidden thoughts and feelings of our heart. Even when he speaks
      of the hidden things of the Spirit of God, he uses the forms or pictures
      of Nature. The world is, as it were, the human, unseen world turned inside
      out, that we may see it. On the walls of the house that he has built for
      us, God has hung up the pictures&mdash;ever-living, ever-changing pictures&mdash;of
      all that passes in our souls. Form and colour and motion are there,&mdash;ever-modelling,
      ever-renewing, never wearying. Without this living portraiture from
      within, we should have no word to utter that should represent a single act
      of the inner world. Metaphysics could have no existence, not to speak of
      poetry, not to speak of the commonest language of affection. But all is
      done in such spiritual suggestion, portrait and definition are so avoided,
      the whole is in such fluent evanescence, that the producing mind is only
      aided, never overwhelmed. It never amounts to representation. It affords
      but the material which the thinking, feeling soul can use, interpret, and
      apply for its own purposes of speech. It is, as it were, the forms of
      thought cast into a lovely chaos by the inferior laws of matter, thence to
      be withdrawn by what we call the creative genius that God has given to
      men, and moulded, and modelled, and arranged, and built up to its own
      shapes and its own purposes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I presume you would say that no mere transcript, if I may use the
      word, of nature is the worthy work of an artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an impossibility to make a mere transcript. No man can help seeing
      nature as he is himself, for she has all in her; but if he sees no meaning
      in especial that he wants to give, his portrait of her will represent only
      her dead face, not her living impassioned countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then artists ought to interpret nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indubitably; but that will only be to interpret themselves&mdash;something
      of humanity that is theirs, whether they have discovered it already or
      not. If to this they can add some teaching for humanity, then indeed they
      may claim to belong to the higher order of art, however imperfect they may
      be in their powers of representing&mdash;however lowly, therefore, their
      position may be in that order.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V. THE SORE SPOT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We went on talking for some time. Indeed we talked so long that the
      dinner-hour was approaching, when one of the maids came with the message
      that Mr. Stokes had called again, wishing to see me. I could not help
      smiling inwardly at the news. I went down at once, and found him smiling
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife do send me for you this time, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Between you and me,
      I cannot help thinking she have something on her mind she wants to tell
      you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she tell you, Mr. Stokes? That would be most natural. And
      then, if you wanted any help about it, why, of course, here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t think well enough of my judgment for that, sir; and I daresay
      she be quite right. She always do make me give in before she have done
      talking. But she have been a right good wife to me, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she would have been a better if you hadn&rsquo;t given in quite so
      much. It is very wrong to give in when you think you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I never be sure of it when she talk to me awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then I have nothing to say except that you ought to have been surer&mdash;<i>sometimes;</i>
      I don&rsquo;t say <i>always.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she do want you very bad now, sir. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll behave to you
      as she did before. Do come, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will&mdash;instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the study, and asked Percivale if he would like to go with
      me. He looked, I thought, as if he would rather not. I saw that it was
      hardly kind to ask him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it is better not,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;for I do not know how long I
      may have to be with the poor woman. You had better wait here and take my
      place at the dinner-table. I promise not to depose you if I should return
      before the meal is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thanked me very heartily. I showed him into the drawing-room, told my
      wife where I was going, and not to wait dinner for me&mdash;I would take
      my chance&mdash;and joined Mr. Stokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea, then,&rdquo; I said, after we had gone about half-way, &ldquo;what
      makes your wife so uneasy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;except it be,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that she was
      too hard, as I thought, upon our Mary, when she wanted to marry beneath
      her, as wife thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How beneath her? Who was it she wanted to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did marry him, sir. She has a bit of her mother&rsquo;s temper, you see,
      and she would take her own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s a lesson to mothers, is it not? If they want to have their
      own way, they mustn&rsquo;t give their own temper to their daughters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how are they to help it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how indeed? But what is your daughter&rsquo;s husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A labourer, sir. He works on a farm out by Carpstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have worked on Mr. Barton&rsquo;s farm for many years, if I don&rsquo;t
      mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, sir; but I am a sort of a foreman now, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t so always; and your son-in-law, whether he work his way
      up or not, is, I presume, much where you were when you married Mrs.
      Stokes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True as you say, sir; and it&rsquo;s not me that has anything to say about it.
      I never gave the man a nay. But you see, my wife, she always do be wanting
      to get her head up in the world; and since she took to the shopkeeping&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shopkeeping!&rdquo; I said, with some surprise; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, sir, it&rsquo;s only for a quarter or so of the year. You know
      it&rsquo;s a favourite walk for the folks as comes here for the bathing&mdash;past
      our house, to see the great cave down below; and my wife, she got a bit of
      a sign put up, and put a few ginger-beer bottles in the window, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad place for the ginger-beer,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were only empty ones, with corks and strings, you know, sir. My
      wife, she know better than put the ginger-beer its own self in the sun.
      But I do think she carry her head higher after that; and a farm-labourer,
      as they call them, was none good enough for her daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hasn&rsquo;t she been kind to her since she married, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s never done her no harm, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she hasn&rsquo;t gone to see her very often, or asked her to come and see
      you very often, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er a one o&rsquo; them crossed the door of the other,&rdquo; he answered,
      with some evident feeling of his own in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah; but you don&rsquo;t approve of that yourself, Stokes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Approve of it? No, sir. I be a farm-labourer once myself; and so I do
      want to see my own daughter now and then. But she take after her mother,
      she do. I don&rsquo;t know which of the two it is as does it, but there&rsquo;s no
      coming and going between Carpstone and this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were approaching the house. I told Stokes he had better let her know I
      was there; for that, if she had changed her mind, it was not too late for
      me to go home again without disturbing her. He came back saying she was
      still very anxious to see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Stokes, how do you feel to-day?&rdquo; I asked, by way of opening
      the conversation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you look much worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I he much worse, sir. You don&rsquo;t know what I suffer, or you wouldn&rsquo;t make
      so little of it. I be very bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are very ill, but I hope you are not too ill to tell me why
      you are so anxious to see me. You have got something to tell me, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With pale and death-like countenance, she appeared to be fighting more
      with herself than with the disease which yet had nearly overcome her. The
      drops stood upon her forehead, and she did not speak. Wishing to help her,
      if I might, I said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it about your daughter you wanted to speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I have nothing to say about my daughter. She was my
      own. I could do as I pleased with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought with myself, we must have a word about that by and by, but
      meantime she must relieve her heart of the one thing whose pressure she
      feels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you want to tell me about something that was not your
      own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I ever took what was not my own?&rdquo; she returned fiercely. &ldquo;Did
      Stokes dare to say I took anything that wasn&rsquo;t my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has said anything of the sort. Only I cannot help thinking, from
      your own words and from your own behaviour, that that must be the cause of
      your misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very hard that the parson should think such things,&rdquo; she muttered
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor woman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you sent for me because you had something to
      confess to me. I want to help you if I can. But you are too proud to
      confess it yet, I see. There is no use in my staying here. It only does
      you harm. So I will bid you good-morning. If you cannot confess to me,
      confess to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows it, I suppose, without that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But that does not make it less necessary for you to confess it. How
      is he to forgive you, if you won&rsquo;t allow that you have done wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It be not so easy that as you think. How would you like to say you had
      took something that wasn&rsquo;t your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t like it, certainly; but if I had it to do, I think I
      should make haste and do it, and so get rid of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the worst of it; I can&rsquo;t get rid of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, laying my hand on hers, and trying to speak as kindly as I
      could, although her whole behaviour would have been exceedingly repulsive
      but for her evidently great suffering, &ldquo;you have now all but confessed
      taking something that did not belong to you. Why don&rsquo;t you summon courage
      and tell me all about it? I want to help you out of the trouble as easily
      as ever I can; but I can&rsquo;t if you don&rsquo;t tell me what you&rsquo;ve got that isn&rsquo;t
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got anything,&rdquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had something, then, whatever may have become of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was again silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose and took up my hat. She stretched out her hand, as if to lay hold
      of me, with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, stop. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. I lost it again. That&rsquo;s the worst
      of it. I got no good of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sovereign,&rdquo; she said, with a groan. &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m a thief, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more a thief than you were before. Rather less, I hope. But do you
      think it would have been any better for you if you hadn&rsquo;t lost it, and had
      got some good of it, as you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t lost it you would most likely have been a great deal worse
      for it than you are&mdash;a more wicked woman altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a wicked woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wicked to steal, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come by it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you try to find out the owner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I knew whose it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was very wicked not to return it. And I say again, that if you
      had not lost the sovereign you would have been most likely a more wicked
      woman than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very hard to lose it. I could have given it back. And then I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have lost my character as I have done this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you could; but I doubt if you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you had it, you are sure you would give it back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I would,&rdquo; she said, looking me so full in the face that I was
      sure she meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you give it back? Would you get your husband to take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the story, you mean I You do not wish to imply that he would not
      restore it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. He would do what I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you return it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should make a parcel of it, and send it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without saying anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Where&rsquo;s the good? The man would have his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he would not. He has a right to your confession, for you have wronged
      him. That would never do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too hard upon me,&rdquo; she said, beginning to weep angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to get the weight of this sin off your mind?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. I am going to die. O dear! O dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that is just what I want to help you in. You must confess, or the
      weight of it will stick there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if I confess, I shall be expected to pay it back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. That is only reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got it, I tell you. I have lost it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not a sovereign in your possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you ask your husband to let you have one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I knew it was no use. I knew you would only make matters worse. I
      do wish I had never seen that wicked money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to abuse the money; it was not wicked. You ought to wish
      that you had returned it. But that is no use; the thing is to return it
      now. Has your husband got a sovereign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He may ha&rsquo; got one since I be laid up. But I never can tell him about
      it; and I should be main sorry to spend one of his hard earning in that
      way, poor man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell him, and we&rsquo;ll manage it somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought for a few moments she would break out in opposition; but she hid
      her face with the sheet instead, and burst into a great weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took this as a permission to do as I had said, and went to the room-door
      and called her husband. He came, looking scared. His wife did not look up,
      but lay weeping. I hoped much for her and him too from this humiliation
      before him, for I had little doubt she needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife, poor woman,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is in great distress because&mdash;I do
      not know when or how&mdash;she picked up a sovereign that did not belong
      to her, and, instead of returning, put it away somewhere and lost it. This
      is what is making her so miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deary me!&rdquo; said Stokes, in the tone with which he would have spoken to a
      sick child; and going up to his wife, he sought to draw down the sheet
      from her face, apparently that he might kiss her; but she kept tight hold
      of it, and he could not. &ldquo;Deary me!&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon put that all
      to rights. When was it, Jane, that you found it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we wanted so to have a pig of our own; and I thought I could soon
      return it,&rdquo; she sobbed from under the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deary me! Ten years ago! Where did you find it, old woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Squire Tresham drop it, as he paid me for some ginger-beer he got
      for some ladies that was with him. I do believe I should ha&rsquo; given it back
      at the time; but he made faces at the ginger-beer, and said it was very
      nasty; and I thought, well, I would punish him for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it was your temper that made a thief of you, then,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My old man won&rsquo;t be so hard on me as you, sir. I wish I had told him
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would wish that too,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;were it not that I am afraid you might
      have persuaded him to be silent about it, and so have made him miserable
      and wicked too. But now, Stokes, what is to be done? This money must be
      paid. Have you got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor man looked blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will never be at ease till this money is paid,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I ain&rsquo;t got it, but I&rsquo;ll borrow it of someone; I&rsquo;ll go to
      master, and ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my good fellow, that won&rsquo;t do. Your master would want to know what
      you were going to do with it, perhaps; and we mustn&rsquo;t let more people know
      about it than just ourselves and Squire Tresham. There is no occasion for
      that. I&rsquo;ll tell you what: I&rsquo;ll give you the money, and you must take it;
      or, if you like, I will take it to the squire, and tell him all about it.
      Do you authorise me to do this, Mrs. Stokes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir. It&rsquo;s very kind of you. I will work hard to pay you again, if
      it please God to spare me. I am very sorry I was so cross-tempered to you,
      sir; but I couldn&rsquo;t bear the disgrace of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said all this from under the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and as soon as I&rsquo;ve had my dinner I&rsquo;ll get a
      horse and ride over to Squire Tresham&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll come back to-night and tell
      you about it. And now I hope you will be able to thank God for forgiving
      you this sin; but you must not hide and cover it up, but confess it clean
      out to him, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made me no answer, but went on sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hastened home, and as I entered sent Walter to ask the loan of a horse
      which a gentleman, a neighbour, had placed at my disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went into the dining-room, I found that they had not sat down to
      dinner. I expostulated: it was against the rule of the house, when my
      return was uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my love,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;why should you not let us please ourselves
      sometimes? Dinner is so much nicer when you are with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad you think so,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But there are the children: it
      is not good for growing creatures to be kept waiting for their meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see there are no children; they have had their dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always in the right, wife; but there&rsquo;s Mr. Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never dine till seven o&rsquo;clock, to save daylight,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am beaten on all points. Let us dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During dinner I could scarcely help observing how Percivale&rsquo;s eyes
      followed Wynnie, or, rather, every now and then settled down upon her
      face. That she was aware, almost conscious of this, I could not doubt. One
      glance at her satisfied me of that. But certain words of the apostle kept
      coming again and again into my mind; for they were winged words those, and
      even when they did not enter they fluttered their wings at my window:
      &ldquo;Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&rdquo; And I kept reminding myself that I
      must heave the load of sin off me, as I had been urging poor Mrs. Stokes
      to do; for God was ever seeking to lift it, only he could not without my
      help, for that would be to do me more harm than good by taking the one
      thing in which I was like him away from me&mdash;my action. Therefore I
      must have faith in him, and not be afraid; for surely all fear is sin, and
      one of the most oppressive sins from which the Lord came to save us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before dinner was over the horse was at the door. I mounted, and set out
      for Squire Tresham&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found him a rough but kind-hearted elderly man. When I told him the
      story of the poor woman&rsquo;s misery, he was quite concerned at her suffering.
      When I produced the sovereign he would not receive it at first, but
      requested me to take it back to her and say she must keep it by way of an
      apology for his rudeness about her ginger-beer; for I took care to tell
      him the whole story, thinking it might be a lesson to him too. But I
      begged him to take it; for it would, I thought, not only relieve her mind
      more thoroughly, but help to keep her from coming to think lightly of the
      affair afterwards. Of course I could not tell him that I had advanced the
      money, for that would have quite prevented him from receiving it. I then
      got on my horse again, and rode straight to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Stokes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all over now. That&rsquo;s one good thing
      done. How do you feel yourself now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel better now, sir. I hope God will forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God does forgive you. But there are more things you need forgiveness for.
      It is not enough to get rid of one sin. We must get rid of all our sins,
      you know. They&rsquo;re not nice things, are they, to keep in our hearts? It is
      just like shutting up nasty corrupting things, dead carcasses, under lock
      and key, in our most secret drawers, as if they were precious jewels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could be good, like some people, but I wasn&rsquo;t made so. There&rsquo;s
      my husband now. I do believe he never do anything wrong in his life. But
      then, you see, he would let a child take him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And far better too. Infinitely better to be taken in. Indeed there is no
      harm in being taken in; but there is awful harm in taking in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, and I went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you would feel a good deal better yet, if you would send for your
      daughter and her husband now, and make it up with them, especially seeing
      you are so ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir. I will directly. I&rsquo;m tired of having my own way. But I was
      made so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t made to continue so, at all events. God gives us the
      necessary strength to resist what is bad in us. He is making at you now;
      only you must give in, else he cannot get on with the making of you. I
      think very likely he made you ill now, just that you might bethink
      yourself, and feel that you had done wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been feeling that for many a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That made it the more needful to make you ill; for you had been feeling
      your duty, and yet not doing it; and that was worst of all. You know Jesus
      came to lift the weight of our sins, our very sins themselves, off our
      hearts, by forgiving them and helping us to cast them away from us.
      Everything that makes you uncomfortable must have sin in it somewhere, and
      he came to save you from it. Send for your daughter and her husband, and
      when you have done that you will think of something else to set right
      that&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there would be no end to that way of it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not, till everything was put right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a body might have nothing else to do, that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the very first thing that has to be done. It is our business
      in this world. We were not sent here to have our own way and try to enjoy
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is hard on a poor woman that has to work for her bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To work for your bread is not to take your own way, for it is God&rsquo;s way.
      But you have wanted many things your own way. Now, if you would just take
      his way, you would find that he would take care you should enjoy your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t had much enjoyment in mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was just because you would not trust him with his own business, but
      must take it into your hands. If you will but do his will, he will take
      care that you have a life to be very glad of and very thankful for. And
      the longer you live, the more blessed you will find it. But I must leave
      you now, for I have talked to you long enough. You must try and get a
      sleep. I will come and see you again to-morrow, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please do, sir; I shall be very grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I rode home I thought, if the lifting of one sin off the human heart
      was like a resurrection, what would it be when every sin was lifted from
      every heart! Every sin, then, discovered in one&rsquo;s own soul must be a
      pledge of renewed bliss in its removing. And when the thought came again
      of what St. Paul had said somewhere, &ldquo;whatsoever is not of faith is sin,&rdquo;
       I thought what a weight of sin had to be lifted from the earth, and how
      blessed it might be. But what could I do for it? I could just begin with
      myself, and pray God for that inward light which is his Spirit, that so I
      might see him in everything and rejoice in everything as his gift, and
      then all things would be holy, for whatsoever is of faith must be the
      opposite of sin; and that was my part towards heaving the weight of sin,
      which, like myriads of gravestones, was pressing the life out of us men,
      off the whole world. Faith in God is life and righteousness&mdash;the
      faith that trusts so that it will obey&mdash;none other. Lord, lift the
      people thou hast made into holy obedience and thanksgiving, that they may
      be glad in this thy world.

      CHAPTER VI. THE GATHERING STORM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weather cleared up again the next day, and for a fortnight it was
      lovely. In this region we saw less of the sadness of the dying year than
      in our own parish, for there being so few trees in the vicinity of the
      ocean, the autumn had nowhere to hang out her mourning flags. But there,
      indeed, so mild is the air, and so equable the temperature all the winter
      through, compared with the inland counties, that the bitterness of the
      season is almost unknown. This, however, is no guarantee against furious
      storms of wind and rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after the occurrence last recorded, Turner paid us another visit.
      I confess I was a little surprised at his being able to get away so soon
      again; for of all men a country surgeon can least easily find time for a
      holiday; but he had managed it, and I had no doubt, from what I knew of
      him, had made thorough provision for his cure in his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought us good news from home. Everything was going on well. Weir was
      working as hard as usual; and everybody agreed that I could not have got a
      man to take my place better.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said he found Connie much improved; and, from my own observations, I
      was sure he was right. She was now able to turn a good way from one side
      to the other, and finding her health so steady besides, Turner encouraged
      her in making gentle and frequent use of her strength, impressing it upon
      her, however, that everything depended on avoiding everything like a jerk
      or twist of any sort. I was with them when he said this. She looked up at
      him with a happy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all I can, Mr. Turner,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to get out of people&rsquo;s way
      as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she saw something in our faces that made her add&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t mind the bother I am; but I do. I want to help, and not
      be helped&mdash;more than other people&mdash;as soon as possible. I will
      therefore be as gentle as mamma and as brave as papa, and see if we don&rsquo;t
      get well, Mr. Turner. I mean to have a ride on old Spry next summer.&mdash;I
      do,&rdquo; she added, nodding her pretty head up from the pillow, when she saw
      the glance the doctor and I exchanged. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she went on, poking
      the eider-down quilt up with her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; said Turner; &ldquo;but mind, you must do nothing out of bravado.
      That won&rsquo;t do at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done,&rdquo; said Connie, putting on a face of mock submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day we carried her out for a few minutes, but hardly laid her down,
      for we were afraid of the damp from the earth. A few feet nearer or
      farther from the soil will make a difference. It was the last time for
      many weeks. Anyone interested in my Connie need not be alarmed: it was
      only because of the weather, not because of her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I was walking home from a visit I had been paying to Mrs. Stokes.
      She was much better, in a fair way to recover indeed, and her mental
      health was improved as well. Her manner to me was certainly very
      different, and the tone of her voice, when she spoke to her husband
      especially, was changed: a certain roughness in it was much modified, and
      I had good hopes that she had begun to climb up instead of sliding down
      the hill of difficulty, as she had been doing hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold and gusty afternoon. The sky eastward and overhead was
      tolerably clear when I set out from home; but when I left the cottage to
      return, I could see that some change was at hand. Shaggy vapours of light
      gray were blowing rapidly across the sky from the west. A wind was blowing
      fiercely up there, although the gusts down below came from the east. The
      clouds it swept along with it were formless, with loose fringes&mdash;disreputable,
      troubled, hasty clouds they were, looking like mischief. They reminded me
      of Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to the West Wind,&rdquo; in which he compares the &ldquo;loose
      clouds&rdquo; to hair, and calls them &ldquo;the locks of the approaching storm.&rdquo; Away
      to the west, a great thick curtain of fog, of a luminous yellow, covered
      all the sea-horizon, extending north and south as far as the eye could
      reach. It looked ominous. A surly secret seemed to lie in its bosom. Now
      and then I could discern the dim ghost of a vessel through it, as tacking
      for north or south it came near enough to the edge of the fog to show
      itself for a few moments, ere it retreated again into its bosom. There was
      exhaustion, it seemed to me, in the air, notwithstanding the coolness of
      the wind, and I was glad when I found myself comfortably seated by the
      drawing-room fire, and saw Wynnie bestirring herself to make the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks stormy, I think, Wynnie,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eye lightened, as she looked out to sea from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to like the idea of it,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me I was like you, papa; and you look as if you liked the idea
      of it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Per se</i>, certainly, a storm is pleasant to me. I should not like a
      world without storms any more than I should like that Frenchman&rsquo;s idea of
      the perfection of the earth, when all was to be smooth as a trim-shaven
      lawn, rocks and mountains banished, and the sea breaking on the shore only
      in wavelets of ginger-beer or lemonade, I forget which. But the older you
      grow, the more sides of a thing will present themselves to your
      contemplation. The storm may be grand and exciting in itself, but you
      cannot help thinking of the people that are in it. Think for a moment of
      the multitude of vessels, great and small, which are gathered within the
      skirts of that angry vapour out there. I fear the toils of the storm are
      around them. Look at the barometer in the hall, my dear, and tell me what
      it says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went and returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not very low, papa&mdash;only at rain; but the moment I touched
      it, the hand dropped an inch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought so. All things look stormy. It may not be very bad here,
      however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make much difference though, does it, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No further than that being creatures in time and space, we must think of
      things from our own standpoint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I remember very well how, when we were children, you would not let
      nurse teach us Dr. Watts&rsquo;s hymns for children, because you said they
      tended to encourage selfishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I remember it very well. Some of them make the contrast between the
      misery of others and our own comforts so immediately the apparent&mdash;mind,
      I only say apparent&mdash;ground of thankfulness, that they are not fit
      for teaching. I do think that if you could put Dr. Watts to the question,
      he would abjure any such intention, saying that only he meant to heighten
      the sense of our obligation. But it does tend to selfishness and, what is
      worse, self-righteousness, and is very dangerous therefore. What right
      have I to thank God that I am not as other men are in anything? I have to
      thank God for the good things he has given to me; but how dare I suppose
      that he is not doing the same for other people in proportion to their
      capacity? I don&rsquo;t like to appear to condemn Dr. Watts&rsquo;s hymns. Certainly
      he has written the very worst hymns I know; but he has likewise written
      the best&mdash;for public worship, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but, papa, I have heard you say that any simple feeling that comes
      of itself cannot be wrong in itself. If I feel a delight in the idea of a
      storm, I cannot help it coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said you could, my dear. I only said that as we get older, other
      things we did not feel at first come to show themselves more to us, and
      impress us more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus my child and I went on, like two pendulums crossing each other in
      their swing, trying to reach the same dead beat of mutual intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Wynnie, &ldquo;you say everybody is in God&rsquo;s hands as well as we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, surely, my dear; as much out in yon stormy haze as here beside the
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we ought not to be miserable about them, even if there comes a
      storm, ought we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, surely. And, besides, I think if we could help any of them, the very
      persons that enjoyed the storm the most would be the busiest to rescue
      them from it. At least, I fancy so. But isn&rsquo;t the tea ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa. I&rsquo;ll just go and tell mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she returned with her mother, and the children had joined us, Wynnie
      resumed the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I am going to say is absurd, papa, and yet I don&rsquo;t see my way
      out of it&mdash;logically, I suppose you would call it. What is the use of
      taking any trouble about them if they are in God&rsquo;s hands? Why should we
      try to take them out of God&rsquo;s hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Wynnie! at least you do not seek to hide your bad logic, or whatever
      you call it. Take them out of God&rsquo;s hands! If you could do that, it would
      be perdition indeed. God&rsquo;s hands is the only safe place in the universe;
      and the universe is in his hands. Are we not in God&rsquo;s hands on the shore
      because we say they are in his hands who go down to the sea in ships? If
      we draw them on shore, surely they are not out of God&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;I see. But God could save them without us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but what would become of us then? God is so good to us, that we must
      work our little salvation in the earth with him. Just as a father lets his
      little child help him a little, that the child may learn to be and to do,
      so God puts it in our hearts to save this life to our fellows, because we
      would instinctively save it to ourselves, if we could. He requires us to
      do our best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God may not mean to save them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may mean them to be drowned&mdash;we do not know. But we know that we
      must try our little salvation, for it will never interfere with God&rsquo;s
      great and good and perfect will. Ours will be foiled if he sees that
      best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But people always say, when anyone escapes unhurt from an accident, &lsquo;by
      the mercy of God.&rsquo; They don&rsquo;t say it is by the mercy of God when he is
      drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>people</i> cannot be expected, ought not, to say what they do not
      feel. Their own first sensation of deliverance from impending death would
      break out in a &lsquo;thank God,&rsquo; and therefore they say it is God&rsquo;s mercy when
      another is saved. If they go farther, and refuse to consider it God&rsquo;s
      mercy when a man is drowned, that is just the sin of the world&mdash;the
      want of faith. But the man who creeps out of the drowning, choking billows
      into the glory of the new heavens and the new earth&mdash;do you think his
      thanksgiving for the mercy of God which has delivered him is less than
      that of the man who creeps, exhausted and worn, out of the waves on to the
      dreary, surf-beaten shore? In nothing do we show less faith than the way
      in which we think and speak about death. &lsquo;O Death, where is thy sting? O
      Grave, where is thy victory?&rsquo; says the apostle. &lsquo;Here, here, here,&rsquo; cry
      the Christian people, &lsquo;everywhere. It is an awful sting, a fearful
      victory. But God keeps it away from us many a time when we ask him&mdash;to
      let it pierce us to the heart, at last, to be sure; but that can&rsquo;t be
      helped.&rsquo; I mean this is how they feel in their hearts who do not believe
      that God is as merciful when he sends death as when he sends life; who,
      Christian people as they are, yet look upon death as an evil thing which
      cannot be avoided, and would, if they might live always, be content to
      live always. Death or Life&mdash;each is God&rsquo;s; for he is not the God of
      the dead, but of the living: there are no dead, for all live to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think we naturally shrink from death, Harry?&rdquo; said my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no doubt about that, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if it be natural, God must have meant that it should be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, to begin with, but not to continue or end with. A child&rsquo;s sole
      desire is for food&mdash;the very best possible to begin with. But how
      would it be if the child should reach, say, two years of age, and refuse
      to share this same food with his little brother? Or what comes of the man
      who never so far rises above the desire for food that <i>nothing</i> could
      make him forget his dinner-hour? Just so the life of Christians should be
      strong enough to overcome the fear of death. We ought to love and believe
      him so much, that when he says we shall not die, we should at least
      believe that death must be something very different from what it looks to
      us to be&mdash;so different, that what we mean by the word does not apply
      to the reality at all; and so Jesus cannot use the word, because it would
      seem to us that he meant what we mean by it, which he, seeing it all
      round, cannot mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does seem quite reasonable,&rdquo; said Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turner had taken no part in the conversation. He, too, had just come in
      from a walk over the hills. He was now standing looking out at the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks uneasy, does she not?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the Atlantic?&rdquo; he returned, looking round. &ldquo;Yes, I think so. I
      am glad she is not a patient of mine. I fear she is going to be very
      feverish, probably delirious before morning. She won&rsquo;t sleep much, and
      will talk rather loud when the tide comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disease has often an ebb and flow like the tide, has it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often. Some diseases are like a plant that has its time to grow and
      blossom, then dies; others, as you say, ebb and flow again and again
      before they vanish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me, however, that the ebb and flow does not belong to the
      disease, but to Nature, which works through the disease. It seems to me
      that my life has its tides, just like the ocean, only a little more
      regularly. It is high water with me always in the morning and the evening;
      in the afternoon life is at its lowest; and I believe it is lowest again
      while we sleep, and hence it comes that to work the brain at night has
      such an injurious effect on the system. But this is perhaps all a fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be some truth in it. But I was just thinking when you spoke to
      me what a happy thing it is that the tide does not vary by an even six
      hours, but has the odd minutes; whence we see endless changes in the
      relation of the water to the times of the day. And then the spring-tides
      and the neap-tides! What a provision there is in the world for change!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Change is one of the forms that infinitude takes for the use of us
      human immortals. But come and have some tea, Turner. You will not care to
      go out again. What shall we do this evening? Shall we all go to Connie&rsquo;s
      room and have some Shakspere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could wish nothing better. What play shall we have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us have the <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo;</i> said Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like to go by contraries, apparently, Ethel. But you&rsquo;re quite right.
      It is in the winter of the year that art must give us its summer. I
      suspect that most of the poetry about spring and summer is written in the
      winter. It is generally when we do not possess that we lay full value upon
      what we lack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one reason,&rdquo; said Wynnie with a roguish look, &ldquo;why I like that
      play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think there might be more than one, Wynnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one reason is enough for a woman at once; isn&rsquo;t it, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of that. But what is your reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the fairies are not allowed to play any tricks with the women. <i>They</i>
      are true throughout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might choose to say that was because they were not tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I might venture to answer that Shakspere&mdash;being true to nature
      always, as you say, papa&mdash;knew very well how absurd it would be to
      represent a woman&rsquo;s feelings as under the influence of the juice of a
      paltry flower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital, Wynnie!&rdquo; said her mother; and Turner and I chimed in with our
      approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you what I like best in the play?&rdquo; said Turner. &ldquo;It is the
      common sense of Theseus in accounting for all the bewilderments of the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ethelwyn, &ldquo;he was wrong after all. What is the use of common
      sense if it leads you wrong? The common sense of Theseus simply amounted
      to this, that he would only believe his own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Mrs. Walton is right, Turner,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For my part, I have more
      admired the open-mindedness of Hippolyta, who would yield more weight to
      the consistency of the various testimony than could be altogether
      counterbalanced by the negation of her own experience. Now I will tell you
      what I most admire in the play: it is the reconciling power of the poet.
      He brings together such marvellous contrasts, without a single shock or
      jar to your feeling of the artistic harmony of the conjunction. Think for
      a moment&mdash;the ordinary commonplace courtiers; the lovers, men and
      women in the condition of all conditions in which fairy-powers might get a
      hold of them; the quarrelling king and queen of Fairyland, with their
      courtiers, Blossom, Cobweb, and the rest, and the court-jester, Puck; the
      ignorant, clownish artisans, rehearsing their play,&mdash;fairies and
      clowns, lovers and courtiers, are all mingled in one exquisite harmony,
      clothed with a night of early summer, rounded in by the wedding of the
      king and queen. But I have talked enough about it. Let us get our books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As we sat in Connie&rsquo;s room, delighting ourselves with the reflex of the
      poet&rsquo;s fancy, the sound of the rising tide kept mingling with the
      fairy-talk and the foolish rehearsal. &ldquo;Musk roses,&rdquo; said Titania; and the
      first of the blast, going round by south to west, rattled the window.
      &ldquo;Good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow,&rdquo; said Bottom; and the roar of the
      waters was in our ears. &ldquo;So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently
      entwist,&rdquo; said Titania; and the blast poured the rain in a spout against
      the window. &ldquo;Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,&rdquo; said
      Theseus; and the wind whistled shrill through the chinks of the bark-house
      opening from the room. We drew the curtains closer, made up the fire
      higher, and read on. It was time for supper ere we had done; and when we
      left Connie to have hers and go to sleep, it was with the hope that,
      through all the rising storm, she would dream of breeze-haunted summer
      woods.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE GATHERED STORM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I woke in the middle of the night and the darkness to hear the wind
      howling. It was wide awake now, and up with intent. It seized the house,
      and shook it furiously; and the rain kept pouring, only I could not hear
      it save in the <i>rallentondo</i> passages of the wind; but through all
      the wind I could hear the roaring of the big waves on the shore. I did not
      wake my wife; but I got up, put on my dressing-gown, and went softly to
      Connie&rsquo;s room, to see whether she was awake; for I feared, if she were,
      she would be frightened. Wynnie always slept in a little bed in the same
      room. I opened the door very gently, and peeped in. The fire was burning,
      for Wynnie was an admirable stoker, and could generally keep the fire in
      all night. I crept to the bedside: there was just light enough to see that
      Connie was fast asleep, and that her dreams were not of storms. It was a
      marvel how well the child always slept. But, as I turned to leave the
      room, Wynnie&rsquo;s voice called me in a whisper. Approaching her bed, I saw
      her wide eyes, like the eyes of the darkness, for I could scarcely see
      anything of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awake, darling?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa. I have been awake a long time; but isn&rsquo;t Connie sleeping
      delightfully? She does sleep so well! Sleep is surely very good for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the best thing for us all, next to God&rsquo;s spirit, I sometimes think,
      my dear. But are you frightened by the storm? Is that what keeps you
      awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is what keeps me awake; but sometimes the house shakes
      so that I do feel a little nervous. I don&rsquo;t know how it is. I never felt
      afraid of anything natural before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What our Lord said about not being afraid of anything that could only
      hurt the body applies here, and in all the terrors of the night. Think
      about him, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do try, papa. Don&rsquo;t you stop; you will get cold. It is a dreadful
      storm, is it not? Suppose there should be people drowning out there now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be, my love. People are dying almost every other moment, I
      suppose, on the face of the earth. Drowning is only an easy way of dying.
      Mind, they are all in God&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, papa. I will turn round and shut my eyes, and fancy that his hand is
      over them, making them dark with his care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it will not be fancy, my darling, if you do. You remember those odd
      but no less devout lines of George Herbert? Just after he says, so
      beautifully, &lsquo;And now with darkness closest weary eyes,&rsquo; he adds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Thus in thy ebony box
  Thou dost enclose us, till the day
  Put our amendment in our way,
  And give new wheels to our disordered clocks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very fond of boxes, by the way. So go to sleep, dear. You are a
      good clock of God&rsquo;s making; but you want new wheels, according to our
      beloved brother George Herbert. Therefore sleep. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was tiresome talk&mdash;was it&mdash;in the middle of the night,
      reader? Well, but my child did not think so, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark, dank, weeping, the morning dawned. All dreary was the earth and sky.
      The wind was still hunting the clouds across the heavens. It lulled a
      little while we sat at breakfast, but soon the storm was up again, and the
      wind raved. I went out. The wind caught me as if with invisible human
      hands, and shook me. I fought with it, and made my way into the village.
      The streets were deserted. I peeped up the inn-yard as I passed: not a man
      or horse was to be seen. The little shops looked as if nobody had crossed
      their thresholds for a week. Not a door was open. One child came out of
      the baker&rsquo;s with a big loaf in her apron. The wind threatened to blow the
      hair off her head, if not herself first into the canal. I took her by the
      hand and led her, or rather, let her lead me home, while I kept her from
      being carried away by the wind. Having landed her safely inside her
      mother&rsquo;s door, I went on, climbed the heights above the village, and
      looked abroad over the Atlantic. What a waste of aimless tossing to and
      fro! Gray mist above, full of falling rain; gray, wrathful waters
      underneath, foaming and bursting as billow broke upon billow. The tide was
      ebbing now, but almost every other wave swept the breakwater. They burst
      on the rocks at the end of it, and rushed in shattered spouts and clouds
      of spray far into the air over their heads. &ldquo;Will the time ever come,&rdquo; I
      thought, &ldquo;when man shall be able to store up even this force for his own
      ends? Who can tell?&rdquo; The solitary form of a man stood at some distance
      gazing, as I was gazing, out on the ocean. I walked towards him, thinking
      with myself who it could be that loved Nature so well that he did not
      shrink from her even in her most uncompanionable moods. I suspected, and
      soon found I was right; it was Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a clashing of water-drops!&rdquo; I said, thinking of a line somewhere in
      Coleridge&rsquo;s Remorse. &ldquo;They are but water-drops, after all, that make this
      great noise upon the rocks; only there is a great many of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Percivale. &ldquo;But look out yonder. You see a single sail,
      close-reefed&mdash;that is all I can see&mdash;away in the mist there? As
      soon as you think of the human struggle with the elements, as soon as you
      know that hearts are in the midst of it, it is a clashing of water-drops
      no more. It is an awful power, with which the will and all that it rules
      have to fight for the mastery, or at least for freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you are right. It is the presence of thought, feeling, effort that
      gives the majesty to everything. It is even a dim attribution of human
      feelings to this tormented, passionate sea that gives it much of its awe;
      although, as we were saying the other day, it is only <i>a picture</i> of
      the troubled mind. But as I have now seen how matters are with the
      elements, and have had a good pluvial bath as well, I think I will go home
      and change my clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have hardly had enough of it yet,&rdquo; returned Percivale. &ldquo;I shall have a
      stroll along the heights here, and when the tide has fallen a little way
      from the foot of the cliffs I shall go down on the sands and watch awhile
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a younger man than I am; but I&rsquo;ve seen the day, as Lear
      says. What an odd tendency we old men have to boast of the past: we would
      be judged by the past, not by the present. We always speak of the strength
      that is withered and gone, as if we had some claim upon it still. But I am
      not going to talk in this storm. I am always talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you as far as the village, and then I will turn and take
      my way along the downs for a mile or two; I don&rsquo;t mind being wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; resumed Percivale, &ldquo;that in some sense the old man&mdash;not
      that I can allow <i>you</i> that dignity yet, Mr. Walton&mdash;has a right
      to regard the past as his own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be scanned,&rdquo; I answered, as we walked towards the village.
      &ldquo;Surely the results of the past are the man&rsquo;s own. Any action of the
      man&rsquo;s, upon which the life in him reposes, remains his. But suppose a man
      had done a good deed once, and instead of making that a foundation upon
      which to build more good, grew so vain of it that he became incapable of
      doing anything more of the same sort, you could not say that the action
      belonged to him still. Therein he has severed his connection with the
      past. Again, what has never in any deep sense been a man&rsquo;s own, cannot
      surely continue to be his afterwards. Thus the things that a man has
      merely possessed once, the very people who most admired him for their
      sakes when he had them, give him no credit for after he has lost them.
      Riches that have taken to themselves wings leave with the poor man only a
      surpassing poverty. Strength, likewise, which can so little depend on any
      exercise of the will in man, passes from him with the years. It was not
      his all the time; it was but lent him, and had nothing to do with his
      inward force. A bodily feeble man may put forth a mighty life-strength in
      effort, and show nothing to the eyes of his neighbour; while the strong
      man gains endless admiration for what he could hardly help. But the effort
      of the one remains, for it was his own; the strength of the other passes
      from him, for it was never his own. So with beauty, which the commonest
      woman acknowledges never to have been hers in seeking to restore it by
      deception. So, likewise, in a great measure with intellect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you take away intellect as well, what do you leave a man that can
      in any way be called his own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly his intellect is not his own. One thing only is his own&mdash;to
      will the truth. This, too, is as much God&rsquo;s gift as everything else: I
      ought to say is more God&rsquo;s gift than anything else, for he gives it to be
      the man&rsquo;s own more than anything else can be. And when he wills the truth,
      he has God himself. Man <i>can</i> possess God: all other things follow as
      necessary results. What poor creatures we should have been if God had not
      made us to do something&mdash;to look heavenwards&mdash;to lift up the
      hands that hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees! Something like this
      was in the mind of the prophet Jeremiah when he said, &lsquo;Thus saith the
      Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man
      glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him
      that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I
      am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in
      the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord.&rsquo; My own
      conviction is, that a vague sense of a far higher life in ourselves than
      we yet know anything about is at the root of all our false efforts to be
      able to think something of ourselves. We cannot commend ourselves, and
      therefore we set about priding ourselves. We have little or no strength of
      mind, faculty of operation, or worth of will, and therefore we talk of our
      strength of body, worship the riches we have, or have not, it is all one,
      and boast of our paltry intellectual successes. The man most ambitious of
      being considered a universal genius must at last confess himself a
      conceited dabbler, and be ready to part with all he knows for one glimpse
      more of that understanding of God which the wise men of old held to be
      essential to every man, but which the growing luminaries of the present
      day will not allow to be even possible for any man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had reached the brow of the heights, and here we parted. A fierce blast
      of wind rushed at me, and I hastened down the hill. How dreary the streets
      did look!&mdash;how much more dreary than the stormy down! I saw no living
      creature as I returned but a terribly draggled dog, a cat that seemed to
      have a bad conscience, and a lovely little girl-face, which, forgetful of
      its own rights, would flatten the tip of the nose belonging to it against
      a window-pane. Every rain-pool was a mimic sea, and had a mimic storm
      within its own narrow bounds. The water went hurrying down the kennels
      like a long brown snake anxious to get to its hole and hide from the
      tormenting wind, and every now and then the rain came in full rout before
      the conquering blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got home, I peeped in at Connie&rsquo;s door the first thing, and saw
      that she was raised a little more than usual; that is, the end of the
      conch against which she leaned was at a more acute angle. She was sitting
      staring, rather than gazing, out at the wild tumult which she could see
      over the shoulder of the down on which her window immediately looked. Her
      face was paler and keener than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Connie, who set you up so straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turner, papa. I wanted to see out, and he raised me himself. He says
      I am so much better, I may have it in the seventh notch as often as I
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you look too tired for it. Hadn&rsquo;t you better lie down again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the storm, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more reason you should not see it if it tires you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not tire me, papa. Only I keep constantly wondering what is going
      to come out of it. It looks so as if something must follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear me come into your room last night, Connie. The storm was
      raging then as loud as it is now, but you were out of its reach&mdash;fast
      asleep. Now it is too much for you. You must lie down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lowered the support, and when I returned from changing my wet garments
      she was already looking much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner I went to my study, but when evening began to fall I went out
      again. I wanted to see how our next neighbours, the sexton and his wife,
      were faring. The wind had already increased in violence. It threatened to
      blow a hurricane. The tide was again rising, and was coming in with great
      rapidity. The old mill shook to the foundation as I passed through it to
      reach the lower part where they lived. When I peeped in from the bottom of
      the stair, I saw no one; but, hearing the steps of someone overhead, I
      called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agnes&rsquo;s voice made answer, as she descended an inner stair which led to
      the bedrooms above&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s gone to church, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to church!&rdquo; I said, a vague pang darting through me as I thought
      whether I had forgotten any service; but the next moment I recalled what
      the old woman had herself told me of her preference for the church during
      a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, Agnes, I remember!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;your mother thinks the weather bad
      enough to take to the church, does she? How do you come to be here now?
      Where is your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here in an hour or so, sir. He don&rsquo;t mind the wet. You see, we
      don&rsquo;t like the old people to be left alone when it blows what the sailors
      call &lsquo;great guns.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of his mother then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There don&rsquo;t be any sea out there, sir. Leastways,&rdquo; she added with a quiet
      smile, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, I suppose, Agnes, that there is never any perturbation of the
      elements out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed; for she understood me well enough. The temper of Joe&rsquo;s mother
      was proverbial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But really, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she don&rsquo;t mind the weather a bit; and though
      we don&rsquo;t live in the same cottage with her, for Joe wouldn&rsquo;t hear of that,
      we see her far oftener than we see my mother, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s quite fair, Agnes. Is Joe very sorry that he married you,
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hung her head, and blushed so deeply through all her sallow
      complexion, that I was sorry I had teased her, and said so. This brought a
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he be, sir. I do think he gets better. He&rsquo;s been working
      very hard the last week or two, and he says it agrees with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen her look half so well. Life was evidently a very
      different thing to both of them now. I left her, and took my way to the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached the churchyard, there, in the middle of the rain and the
      gathering darkness, was the old man busy with the duties of his calling. A
      certain headstone stood right under a drip from the roof of the southern
      transept; and this drip had caused the mould at the foot of the stone, on
      the side next the wall, to sink, so that there was a considerable crack
      between the stone and the soil. The old man had cut some sod from another
      part of the churchyard, and was now standing, with the rain pouring on him
      from the roof, beating this sod down in the crack. He was sheltered from
      the wind by the church, but he was as wet as he could be. I may mention
      that he never appeared in the least disconcerted when I came upon him in
      the discharge of his functions: he was so content with his own feeling in
      the matter, that no difference of opinion could disturb him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will never do, Coombes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You will get your death of cold.
      You must be as full of water as a sponge. Old man, there&rsquo;s rheumatism in
      the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It be only my work, sir. But I believe I ha&rsquo; done now for a night. I
      think he&rsquo;ll be a bit more comfortable now. The very wind could get at him
      through that hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do go home, then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and change your clothes. Is your wife in the
      church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She be, sir. This door, sir&mdash;this door,&rdquo; he added, as he saw me
      going round to the usual entrance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lifted the great latch and entered. I could not see her at first, for it
      was much darker inside the church. It felt very quiet in there somehow,
      although the place was full of the noise of winds and waters. Mrs. Coombes
      was not sitting on the bell-keys, where I looked for her first, for the
      wind blew down the tower in many currents and draughts&mdash;how it did
      roar up there&mdash;as if the louvres had been a windsail to catch the
      wind and send it down to ventilate the church!&mdash;she was sitting at
      the foot of the chancel-rail, with her stocking as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of her sweet old face, lighted up by a moonlike smile as I drew
      near her, in the middle of the ancient dusk filled with sounds, but only
      sounds of tempest, gave me a sense of one dwelling in the secret place of
      the Most High, such as I shall never forget. It was no time to say much,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you mean to stay here, Mrs. Coombes?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Not all
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not all night, surely, sir. But I hadn&rsquo;t thought o&rsquo; going yet for a
      bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why there&rsquo;s Coombes out there, wet to the skin; and I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll go
      on pottering at the churchyard bed-clothes till he gets his bones as full
      of rheumatism as they can hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deary me! I didn&rsquo;t know as my old man was there. He tould me he had them
      all comforble for the winter a week ago. But to be sure there&rsquo;s always
      some mendin&rsquo; to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard the voice of Joe outside, and the next moment he came into the
      church. After speaking to me, he turned to Mrs. Coombes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be comin&rsquo; home with me, mother. This will never do. Father&rsquo;s as wet
      as a mop. I ha&rsquo; brought something for your supper, and Aggy&rsquo;s a-cookin&rsquo; of
      it; and we&rsquo;re going to be comfortable over the fire, and have a chapter or
      two of the New Testament to keep down the noise of the sea. There! Come
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman drew her cloak over her head, put her knitting carefully in
      her pocket, and stood aside for me to lead the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the shepherd and you&rsquo;re the sheep, so I&rsquo;ll drive
      you before me&mdash;at least, you and Coombes. Joe here will be offended
      if I take on me to say I am <i>his</i> shepherd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, don&rsquo;t say that, sir. You&rsquo;ve been a good shepherd to me when I
      was a very sulky sheep. But if you&rsquo;ll please to go, sir, I&rsquo;ll lock the
      door behind; for you know in them parts the shepherd goes first and the
      sheep follow the shepherd. And I&rsquo;ll follow like a good sheep,&rdquo; he added,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Joe,&rdquo; I said, and took the lead without more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was struck by his saying <i>them parts</i>, which seemed to indicate a
      habit of pondering on the places as well as circumstances of the
      gospel-story. The sexton joined us at the door, and we all walked to his
      cottage, Joe taking care of his mother-in-law and I taking what care I
      could of Coombes by carrying his tools for him. But as we went I feared I
      had done ill in that, for the wind blew so fiercely that I thought the
      thin feeble little man would have got on better if he had been more
      heavily weighted against it. But I made him take a hold of my arm, and so
      we got in. The old man took his tools from me and set them down in the
      mill, for the roof of which I felt some anxiety as we passed through, so
      full of wind was the whole space. But when we opened the inner door the
      welcome of a glowing fire burst up the stair as if that had been a well of
      warmth and light below. I went down with them. Coombes departed to change
      his clothes, and the rest of us stood round the fire, where Agnes was busy
      cooking something like white puddings for their supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear, sir,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;that the coastguard is off to the
      Goose-pot? There&rsquo;s a vessel ashore there, they say. I met them on the road
      with the rocket-cart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far off is that, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some five or six miles, I suppose, along the coast nor&rsquo;ards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a vessel is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know. Some say she be a schooner, others a brigantine. The
      coast-guard didn&rsquo;t know themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo; said Mrs. Coombes. &ldquo;If any of them comes ashore, they&rsquo;ll be
      sadly knocked to pieces on the rocks in a night like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had caught a little infection of her husband&rsquo;s mode of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not likely to clear up before morning, I fear; is it, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, sir. There&rsquo;s no likelihood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you condescend to sit down and take a share with us, sir?&rdquo; said the
      old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would be no condescension in that, Mrs. Coombes. I will another
      time with all my heart; but in such a night I ought to be at home with my
      own people. They will be more uneasy if I am away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse, of coorse, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll bid you good-night. I wish this storm were well over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I buttoned my great-coat, pulled my hat down on my head, and set out. It
      was getting on for high water. The night was growing very dark. There
      would be a moon some time, but the clouds were so dense she could not do
      much while they came between. The roaring of the waves on the shore was
      terrible; all I could see of them now was the whiteness of their breaking,
      but they filled the earth and the air with their furious noises. The wind
      roared from the sea; two oceans were breaking on the land, only to the one
      had been set a hitherto&mdash;to the other none. Ere the night was far
      gone, however, I had begun to doubt whether the ocean itself had not
      broken its bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the whole household full of the storm. The children kept pressing
      their faces to the windows, trying to pierce, as by force of will, through
      the darkness, and discover what the wild thing out there was doing. They
      could see nothing: all was one mass of blackness and dismay, with a soul
      in it of ceaseless roaring. I ran up to Connie&rsquo;s room, and found that she
      was left alone. She looked restless, pale, and frightened. The house
      quivered, and still the wind howled and whistled through the adjoining
      bark-hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connie, darling, have they left you alone?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only for a few minutes, papa. I don&rsquo;t mind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t he frightened at the storm, my dear. He who could walk on the sea
      of Galilee, and still the storm of that little pool, can rule the Atlantic
      just as well. Jeremiah says he &lsquo;divideth the sea when the waves thereof
      roar.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same moment Dora came running into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the spray&mdash;such a lot of it&mdash;came dashing on
      the windows in the dining-room. Will it break them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, my dear. Just stay with Connie while I run down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, papa! I do want to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to see, Dora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as black as pitch. You can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but I want to&mdash;to&mdash;be beside it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay with Connie, if you are not willing. Go along. Ask
      Wynnie to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child was so possessed by the commotion without that she did not seem
      even to see my rebuke, not to say feel it. She ran off, and Wynnie
      presently came. I left her with Connie, put on a long waterproof cloak,
      and went down to the dining-room. A door led from it immediately on to the
      little green in front of the house, between it and the sea. The
      dining-room was dark, for they had put out the lights that they might see
      better from the windows. The children and some of the servants were there
      looking out. I opened the door cautiously. It needed the strength of two
      of the women to shut it behind me. The moment I opened it a great sheet of
      spray rushed over me. I went down the little grassy slope. The rain had
      ceased, and it was not quite so dark as I had expected. I could see the
      gleaming whiteness all before me. The next moment a wave rolled over the
      low wall in front of me, breaking on it and wrapping me round in a sheet
      of water. Something hurt me sharply on the leg; and I found, on searching,
      that one of the large flat stones that lay for coping on the top of the
      wall was on the grass beside me. If it had struck me straight, it must
      have broken my leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a little lull in the wind, and just as I turned to go into the
      house again, I thought I heard a gun. I stood and listened, but heard
      nothing more, and fancied I must have been mistaken. I returned and tapped
      at the door; but I had to knock loudly before they heard me within. When I
      went up to the drawing-room, I found that Percivale had joined our party.
      He and Turner were talking together at one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear a gun?&rdquo; I asked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Was there one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I half-fancied I heard one, but no other followed. There
      will be a good many fired to-night, though, along this awful coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they keep the life-boat always ready,&rdquo; said Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No life-boat even, I fear, would live in such a sea,&rdquo; I said, remembering
      what the officer of the coast-guard had told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would try, though, I suppose,&rdquo; said Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Percivale. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the people. But I have seen
      a life-boat out in as bad a night&mdash;whether in as bad a sea, I cannot
      tell: that depends on the coast, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went on chatting for some time, wondering how the coast-guard had fared
      with the vessel ashore at the Goose-pot. Wynnie joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Connie, now, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very restless and excited, papa. I came down to say, that if Mr. Turner
      didn&rsquo;t mind, I wish he would go up and see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;instantly,&rdquo; said Turner, and moved to follow Winnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the same moment, as if it had been beside us in the room, so clear, so
      shrill was it, we heard Connie&rsquo;s voice shrieking, &ldquo;Papa, papa! There&rsquo;s a
      great ship ashore down there. Come, come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turner and I rushed from the room in fear and dismay. &ldquo;How? What? Where
      could the voice come from?&rdquo; was the unformed movement of our thoughts. But
      the moment we left the drawing-room the thing was clear, though not the
      less marvellous and alarming. We forgot all about the ship, and thought
      only of our Connie. So much does the near hide the greater that is afar!
      Connie kept on calling, and her voice guided our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little stair led immediately from this floor up to the bark-hut, so that
      it might be reached without passing through the bedroom. The door at the
      top of it was open. The door that led from Connie&rsquo;s room into the bark-hut
      was likewise open, and light shone through it into the place&mdash;enough
      to show a figure standing by the furthest window with face pressed against
      the glass. And from this figure came the cry, &ldquo;Papa, papa! Quick, quick!
      The waves will knock her to pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In very truth it was Connie standing there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE SHIPWRECK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Things that happen altogether have to be told one after the other. Turner
      and I both rushed at the narrow stair. There was not room for more than
      one upon it. I was first, but stumbled on the lowest step and fell. Turner
      put his foot on my back, jumped over me, sprang up the stair, and when I
      reached the top of it after him, he was meeting me with Connie in his
      arms, carrying her back to her room. But the girl kept crying&mdash;&ldquo;Papa,
      papa, the ship, the ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My duty woke in me. Turner could attend to Connie far better than I could.
      I made one spring to the window. The moon was not to be seen, but the
      clouds were thinner, and light enough was soaking through them to show a
      wave-tormented mass some little way out in the bay; and in that one moment
      in which I stood looking, a shriek pierced the howling of the wind,
      cutting through it like a knife. I rushed bare-headed from the house. When
      or how the resolve was born in me I do not know, but I flew straight to
      the sexton&rsquo;s, snatched the key from the wall, crying only &ldquo;ship ashore!&rdquo;
       and rushed to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember my hand trembled so that I could hardly get the key into the
      lock. I made myself quieter, opened the door, and feeling my way to the
      tower, knelt before the keys of the bell-hammers, opened the chest, and
      struck them wildly, fiercely. An awful jangling, out of tune and harsh,
      burst into monstrous being in the storm-vexed air. Music itself was
      untuned, corrupted, and returning to chaos. I struck and struck at the
      keys. I knew nothing of their normal use. Noise, outcry, <i>reveillé</i>
      was all I meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes I heard voices and footsteps. From some parts of the
      village, out of sight of the shore, men and women gathered to the summons.
      Through the door of the church, which I had left open, came voices in
      hurried question. &ldquo;Ship ashore!&rdquo; was all I could answer, for what was to
      be done I was helpless to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered that so few appeared at the cry of the bells. After those first
      nobody came for what seemed a long time. I believe, however, I was beating
      the alarum for only a few minutes altogether, though when I look back upon
      the time in the dark church, it looks like half-an-hour at least. But
      indeed I feel so confused about all the doings of that night that in
      attempting to describe them in order, I feel as if I were walking in a
      dream. Still, from comparing mine with the recollected impressions of
      others, I think I am able to give a tolerably correct result. Most of the
      incidents seem burnt into my memory so that nothing could destroy the
      depth of the impression; but the order in which they took place is none
      the less doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand was laid on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; I said; for it was far too dark to know anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percivale. What is to be done? The coastguard is away. Nobody seems to
      know about anything. It is of no use to go on ringing more. Everybody is
      out, even to the maid-servants. Come down to the shore, and you will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is there not the life-boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody seems to know anything about it, except &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no manner of use to
      go trying of that with such a sea on.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be someone in command of it,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Percivale; &ldquo;but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be one of the crew
      amongst the crowd. All the sailor-like fellows are going about with their
      hands in their pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us make haste, then,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;perhaps we can find out. Are you sure
      the coastguard have nothing to do with the life-boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not. They have enough to do with their rockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember now that Roxton told me he had far more confidence in his
      rockets than in anything a life-boat could do, upon this coast at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While we spoke we came to the bank of the canal. This we had to cross, in
      order to reach that part of the shore opposite which the wreck lay. To my
      surprise the canal itself was in a storm, heaving and tossing and dashing
      over its banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percivale,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;the gates are gone; the sea has torn them
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. Would God I could get half-a-dozen men to help me. I
      have been doing what I could; but I have no influence amongst them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What could you do if you had a thousand men
      at your command?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made me no answer for a few moments, during which we were hurrying on
      for the bridge over the canal. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They regard me only as a meddling stranger, I suppose; for I have been
      able to get no useful answer. They are all excited; but nobody is doing
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must know about it a great deal better than we,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;and we
      must take care not to do them the injustice of supposing they are not
      ready to do all that can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percivale was silent yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The record of our conversation looks as quiet on the paper as if we had
      been talking in a curtained room; but all the time the ocean was raving in
      my very ear, and the awful tragedy was going on in the dark behind us. The
      wind was almost as loud as ever, but the rain had quite ceased, and when
      we reached the bridge the moon shone out white, as if aghast at what she
      had at length succeeded in pushing the clouds aside that she might see.
      Awe and helplessness oppressed us. Having crossed the canal, we turned to
      the shore. There was little of it left; for the waves had rushed up almost
      to the village. The sand and the roads, every garden wall, every window
      that looked seaward was crowded with gazers. But it was a wonderfully
      quiet crowd, or seemed so at least; for the noise of the wind and the
      waves filled the whole vault, and what was spoken was heard only in the
      ear to which it was spoken. When we came amongst them we heard only a
      murmur as of more articulated confusion. One turn, and we saw the centre
      of strife and anxiety&mdash;the heart of the storm that filled heaven and
      earth, upon which all the blasts and the billows broke and raved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out there in the moonlight lay a mass of something whose place was
      discernible by the flashing of the waves as they burst over it. She was
      far above low-water mark&mdash;lay nearer the village by a furlong than
      the spot where we had taken our last dinner on the shore. It was strange
      to think that yesterday the spot lay bare to human feet, where now so many
      men and women were isolated in a howling waste of angry waters; for the
      cry of women came plainly to our ears, and we were helpless to save them.
      It was terrible to have to do nothing. Percivale went about hurriedly,
      talking to this one and that one, as if he still thought something might
      be done. He turned to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do try, Mr. Walton, and find out for me where the captain of the
      life-boat is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to a sailor-like man who stood at my elbow and asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, I assure you, sir,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;no boat could live in such
      a sea. It would be throwing away the men&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where the captain lives?&rdquo; Percivale asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did, I tell you it is of no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the captain yourself?&rdquo; returned Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to you?&rdquo; he answered, surly now. &ldquo;I know my own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same moment several of the crowd nearest the edge of the water made a
      simultaneous rush into the surf, and laid hold of something, which, as
      they returned drawing it to the shore, I saw to be a human form. It was
      the body of a woman&mdash;alive or dead I could not tell. I could just see
      the long hair hanging from the head, which itself hung backward helplessly
      as they bore her up the bank. I saw, too, a white face, and I can recall
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run, Percivale,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and fetch Turner. She may not be dead yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Percivale. &ldquo;You had better go yourself, Mr. Walton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke hurriedly. I saw he must have some reason for answering me so
      abruptly. He was talking to a young fellow whom I recognised as one of the
      most dissolute in the village; and just as I turned to go they walked away
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sped home as fast as I could. It was easier to get along now that the
      moon shone. I found that Turner had given Connie a composing draught, and
      that he had good hopes she would at least be nothing the worse for the
      marvellous result of her excitement. She was asleep exhausted, and her
      mother was watching by her side. It, seemed strange that she could sleep;
      but Turner said it was the safest reaction, partly, however, occasioned by
      what he had given her. In her sleep she kept on talking about the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hurried back to see if anything could be done for the woman. As we went
      up the side of the canal we perceived a dark body meeting us. The clouds
      had again obscured, though not quite hidden the moon, and we could not at
      first make out what it was. When we came nearer it showed itself a body of
      men hauling something along. Yes, it was the life-boat, afloat on the
      troubled waves of the canal, each man seated in his own place, his hands
      quiet upon his oar, his cork-jacket braced about him, his feet out before
      him, ready to pull the moment they should pass beyond the broken gates of
      the lock out on the awful tossing of the waves. They sat very silent, and
      the men on the path towed them swiftly along. The moon uncovered her face
      for a moment, and shone upon the faces of two of the rowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percivale! Joe!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir!&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your wife know of it, Joe?&rdquo; I almost gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first chance I&rsquo;ve had of returning
      thanks for her. Please God, I shall see her again to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, Joe. Trust in God, my men, whether you sink or swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; they answered as one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is your doing, Percivale,&rdquo; I said, turning and walking alongside of
      the boat for a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more Jim Allen&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Percivale. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t got a hold of him I
      couldn&rsquo;t have done anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Jim Allen!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be a better man after this, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Donnow, sir,&rdquo; returned Jim cheerily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder work than pulling an
      oar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain himself was on board. Percivale having persuaded Jim Allen,
      the two had gone about in the crowd seeking proselytes. In a wonderfully
      short space they had found almost all the crew, each fresh one picking up
      another or more; till at length the captain, protesting against the folly
      of it, gave in, and once having yielded, was, like a true Englishman, as
      much in earnest as any of them. The places of two who were missing were
      supplied by Percivale and Joe, the latter of whom would listen to no
      remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to lose,&rdquo; Percivale had said. &ldquo;You have a young wife, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve everything to win,&rdquo; Joe had returned. &ldquo;The only thing that makes me
      feel a bit faint-hearted over it, is that I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s not my duty that
      drives me to it, but the praise of men, leastways of a woman. What would
      Aggy think of me if I was to let them drown out there and go to my bed and
      sleep? I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Joe,&rdquo; returned Percivale, &ldquo;I daresay you are right. You can
      row, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can row hard, and do as I&rsquo;m told,&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Percivale; &ldquo;come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I heard afterwards. We were now hurrying against the wind towards the
      mouth of the canal, some twenty men hauling on the tow-rope. The critical
      moment would be in the clearing of the gates, I thought, some parts of
      which might remain swinging; but they encountered no difficulty there, as
      I heard afterwards. For I remembered that this was not my post, and turned
      again to follow the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, my men!&rdquo; I said, and left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave a great hurrah, and sped on to meet their fate. I found Turner
      in the little public-house, whither they had carried the body. The woman
      was quite dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear it is an emigrant vessel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; I asked, in some consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and look at the body,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that of a woman about twenty, tall, and finely formed. The face was
      very handsome, but it did not need the evidence of the hands to prove that
      she was one of our sisters who have to labour for their bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should such a girl be doing on board ship but going out to America
      or Australia&mdash;to her lover, perhaps,&rdquo; said Turner. &ldquo;You see she has a
      locket on her neck; I hope nobody will dare to take it off. Some of these
      people are not far derived from those who thought a wreck a Godsend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sound of many feet was at the door just as we turned to leave the house.
      They were bringing another body&mdash;that of an elderly woman&mdash;dead,
      quite dead. Turner had ceased examining her, and we were going out
      together, when, through all the tumult of the wind and waves, a fierce
      hiss, vindictive, wrathful, tore the air over our heads. Far up, seawards,
      something like a fiery snake shot from the high ground on the right side
      of the bay, over the vessel, and into the water beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! that&rsquo;s the coastguard,&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rushed through the village, and up on the heights, where they had
      planted their apparatus. A little crowd surrounded them. How dismal the
      sea looked in the struggling moonlight! I felt as if I were wandering in
      the mazes of an evil dream. But when I approached the cliff, and saw down
      below the great mass, of the vessel&rsquo;s hulk, with the waves breaking every
      moment upon her side, I felt the reality awful indeed. Now and then there
      would come a kind of lull in the wild sequence of rolling waters, and then
      I fancied for a moment that I saw how she rocked on the bottom. Her masts
      had all gone by the board, and a perfect chaos of cordage floated and
      swung in the waves that broke over her. But her bowsprit remained entire,
      and shot out into the foamy dark, crowded with human beings. The first
      rocket had missed. They were preparing to fire another. Roxton stood with
      his telescope in his hand, ready to watch the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a terrible job, sir,&rdquo; he said when I approached him; &ldquo;I doubt if
      we shall save one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the life-boat!&rdquo; I cried, as a dark spot appeared on the waters
      approaching the vessel from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The life-boat!&rdquo; he returned with contempt. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say they&rsquo;ve
      got <i>her</i> out! She&rsquo;ll only add to the mischief. We&rsquo;ll have to save
      her too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was still some way from the vessel, and in comparatively smooth water.
      But between her and the hull the sea raved in madness; the billows rode
      over each other, in pursuit, as it seemed, of some invisible prey. Another
      hiss, as of concentrated hatred, and the second rocket was shooting its
      parabola through the dusky air. Roxton raised his telescope to his eye the
      same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over her starn!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fellow getting down from the
      cat-head to run aft.&mdash;Stop, stop!&rdquo; he shouted involuntarily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      an awful wave on your quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was swallowed in the roaring of the storm. I fancied I could
      distinguish a dark something shoot from the bows towards the stern. But
      the huge wave fell upon the wreck. The same moment Roxton exclaimed&mdash;so
      coolly as to amaze me, forgetting how men must come to regard familiar
      things without discomposure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone! I said so. The next&rsquo;ll have better luck, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That man came ashore alive, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were forward of the foremast. The bowsprit, when I looked through
      Roxton&rsquo;s telescope, was shapeless as with a swarm of bees. Now and then a
      single shriek rose upon the wild air. But now my attention was fixed on
      the life-boat. She had got into the wildest of the broken water; at one
      moment she was down in a huge cleft, the next balanced like a beam on the
      knife-edge of a wave, tossed about hither and thither, as if the waves
      delighted in mocking the rudder; but hitherto she had shipped no water. I
      am here drawing upon the information I have since received; but I did see
      how a huge wave, following close upon the back of that on which she
      floated, rushed, towered up over her, toppled, and fell upon the life-boat
      with tons of water: the moon was shining brightly enough to show this with
      tolerable distinctness. The boat vanished. The next moment, there she was,
      floating helplessly about, like a living thing stunned by the blow of the
      falling wave. The struggle was over. As far as I could see, every man was
      in his place; but the boat drifted away before the storm shore-wards, and
      the men let her drift. Were they all killed as they sat? I thought of my
      Wynnie, and turned to Roxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wave has done for them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told you it was no use. There
      they go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is the matter?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;The men are sitting every man in his
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Two were swept overboard, but they caught the
      ropes and got in again. But don&rsquo;t you see they have no oars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That wave had broken every one of them off at the rowlocks, and now they
      were as helpless as a sponge.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned and ran. Before I reached the brow of the hill another rocket was
      fired and fell wide shorewards, partly because the wind blew with fresh
      fury at the very moment. I heard Roxton say&mdash;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s breaking up. It&rsquo;s
      no use. That last did for her;&rdquo; but I hurried off for the other side of
      the bay, to see what became of the life-boat. I heard a great cry from the
      vessel as I reached the brow of the hill, and turned for a parting glance.
      The dark mass had vanished, and the waves were rushing at will over the
      space. When I got to the shore the crowd was less. Many were running, like
      myself, towards the other side, anxious about the life-boat. I hastened
      after them; for Percivale and Joe filled my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They led the way to the little beach in front of the parsonage. It would
      be well for the crew if they were driven ashore there, for it was the only
      spot where they could escape being dashed on rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crowd before the garden-wall, a bustle, and great confusion of
      speech. The people, men and women, boys and girls, were all gathered about
      the crew of the life-boat,&mdash;which already lay, as if it knew of
      nothing but repose, on the grass within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Percivale!&rdquo; I cried, making my way through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Harper!&rdquo; I cried again, searching with eager eyes amongst the crew,
      to whom everybody was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no answer; and from the disjointed phrases I heard, I
      could gather nothing. All at once I saw Wynnie looking over the wall,
      despair in her face, her wide eyes searching wildly through the crowd. I
      could not look at her till I knew the worst. The captain was talking to
      old Coombes. I went up to him. As soon as he saw me, he gave me his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Percivale?&rdquo; I asked, with all the calmness I could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took me by the arm, and drew me out of the crowd, nearer to the waves,
      and a little nearer to the mouth of the canal. The tide had fallen
      considerably, else there would not have been standing-room, narrow as it
      was, which the people now occupied. He pointed in the direction of the
      Castle-rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the stranger gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Joe Harper, the blacksmith,&rdquo; I interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re there, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean those two&mdash;just those two&mdash;are drowned?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I don&rsquo;t say that; but God knows they have little chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help thinking that God might know they were not in the
      smallest danger. But I only begged him to tell me where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that schooner there, just between you and the Castle-rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I can see nothing. Stay. I fancy I can. But I am always
      ready to fancy I see a thing when I am told it is there. I can&rsquo;t say I see
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, though. The gentleman you mean, and Joe Harper too, are, I
      believe, on board of that schooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she aground?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear no, sir. She&rsquo;s a light craft, and can swim there well enough. If
      she&rsquo;d been aground, she&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been ashore in pieces hours ago. But whether
      she&rsquo;ll ride it out, God only knows, as I said afore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ever did they get aboard of her? I never saw her from the heights
      opposite.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;You were all taken up by the ship ashore, you see, sir. And she don&rsquo;t
      make much show in this light. But there she is, and they&rsquo;re aboard of her.
      And this is how it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on to give me his part of the story; but I will now give the whole
      of it myself, as I have gathered and pieced it together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men had been swept overboard, as Roxton said&mdash;one of them was
      Percivale&mdash;but they had both got on board again, to drift, oarless,
      with the rest&mdash;now in a windless valley&mdash;now aloft on a
      tempest-swept hill of water&mdash;away towards a goal they knew not,
      neither had chosen, and which yet they could by no means avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little out of the full force of the current, and not far from the
      channel of the small stream, which, when the tide was out, flowed across
      the sands nearly from the canal gates to the Castle-rock, lay a little
      schooner, belonging to a neighbouring port, Boscastle, I think, which,
      caught in the storm, had been driven into the bay when it was almost dark,
      some considerable time before the great ship. The master, however, knew
      the ground well. The current carried him a little out of the wind, and
      would have thrown him upon the rocks next, but he managed to drop anchor
      just in time, and the cable held; and there the little schooner hung in
      the skirts of the storm, with the jagged teeth of the rocks within an
      arrow flight. In the excitement of the great wreck, no one had observed
      the danger of the little coasting bird. If the cable held till the tide
      went down, and the anchor did not drag, she would be safe; if not, she
      must be dashed to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the schooner were two men and a boy: two men had been washed overboard
      an hour or so before they reached the bay. When they had dropped their
      anchor, they lay down exhausted on the deck. Indeed they were so worn out
      that they had been unable to drop their sheet anchor, and were holding on
      only by their best bower. Had they not been a good deal out of the wind,
      this would have been useless. Even if it held she was in danger of having
      her bottom stove in by bumping against the sands as the tide went out. But
      that they had not to think of yet. The moment they lay down they fell fast
      asleep in the middle of the storm. While they slept it increased in
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly one of them awoke, and thought he saw a vision of angels. For
      over his head faces looked down upon him from the air&mdash;that is, from
      the top of a great wave. The same moment he heard a voice, two of the
      angels dropped on the deck beside him, and the rest vanished. Those angels
      were Percivale and Joe. And angels they were, for they came just in time,
      as all angels do&mdash;never a moment too soon or a moment too late: the
      schooner <i>was</i> dragging her anchor. This was soon plain even to the
      less experienced eyes of the said angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not take them many minutes now to drop their strongest anchor,
      and they were soon riding in perfect safety for some time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the two men was the son of old Coombes, the sexton, who was engaged
      to marry the girl I have spoken of in the end of the fourth chapter in the
      second volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percivale&rsquo;s account of the matter, as far as he was concerned, was, that
      as they drifted helplessly along, he suddenly saw from the top of a huge
      wave the little vessel below him. They were, in fact, almost upon the
      rigging. The wave on which they rode swept the quarter-deck of the
      schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percivale says the captain of the lifeboat called out &ldquo;Aboard!&rdquo; The
      captain said he remembered nothing of the sort. If he did, he must have
      meant it for the men on the schooner to get on board the lifeboat.
      Percivale, however, who had a most chivalrous (ought I not to say
      Christian?) notion of obedience, fancying the captain meant them to board
      the schooner, sprang at her fore-shrouds. Thereupon the wave sweeping them
      along the schooner&rsquo;s side, Joe sprang at the main-shrouds, and they
      dropped on the deck together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although my reader is at ease about their fate, we who were in the
      affair were anything but easy at the time corresponding to this point of
      the narrative. It was a terrible night we passed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned, which was almost instantly, for I could do nothing by
      staring out in the direction of the schooner, I found that the crowd was
      nearly gone. One little group alone remained behind, the centre of which
      was a woman. Wynnie had disappeared. The woman who remained behind was
      Agnes Harper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon shone out clear as I approached the group; indeed, the clouds
      were breaking-up and drifting away off the heavens. The storm had raved
      out its business, and was departing into the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agnes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered, and looked up as if waiting for a command. There
      was no colour in her cheeks or in her lips&mdash;at least it seemed so in
      the moonlight&mdash;only in her eyes. But she was perfectly calm. She was
      leaning against the low wall, with her hands clasped, but hanging quietly
      down before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm is breaking-up, Agnes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered in the same still tone. Then, after just a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, she spoke out of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s at his duty, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have given the utterance a point of interrogation; whether she meant
      that point I am not quite sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indubitably,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;I have such faith in Joe, that I should be
      sure of that in any case. At all events, he&rsquo;s not taking care of his own
      life. And if one is to go wrong, I would ten thousand times rather err on
      that side. But I am sure Joe has been doing right, and nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing to be said, sir, is there?&rdquo; she returned, with a
      sigh that sounded as of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      I presume some of the surrounding condolers had been giving her Job&rsquo;s
      comfort by blaming her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Agnes, what the Lord said to his mother when she
      reproached him with having left her and his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember anything at this moment, sir,&rdquo; was her touching answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will tell you. He said, &lsquo;Why did you look for me? Didn&rsquo;t you know
      that I must be about something my Father had given me to do?&rsquo; Now, Joe was
      and is about his Father&rsquo;s business, and you must not be anxious about him.
      There could be no better reason for not being anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Agnes was a very quiet woman. When without a word she took my hand and
      kissed it, I felt what a depth there was in the feeling she could not
      utter. I did not withdraw my hand, for I knew that would be to rebuke her
      love for Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in and wait?&rdquo; I said indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, sir. I must go to my mother. God will look after Joe,
      won&rsquo;t he, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as there is a God, Agnes,&rdquo; I said; and she went away without
      another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand on the top of the wall and jumped over. I started back with
      terror, for I had almost alighted on the body of a woman lying there. The
      first insane suggestion was that it had been cast ashore; but the next
      moment I knew that it was my own Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not even fainted. She was lying with her handkerchief stuffed into
      her mouth to keep her from screaming. When I uttered her name she rose,
      and, without looking at me, walked away towards the house. I followed. She
      went straight to her own room and shut the door. I went to find her
      mother. She was with Connie, who was now awake, lying pale and frightened.
      I told Ethelwyn that Percivale and Joe were on board the little schooner,
      which was holding on by her anchor, that Wynnie was in terror about
      Percivale, that I had found her lying on the wet grass, and that she must
      get her into a warm bath and to bed. We went together to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in the middle of the floor, with her hands pressed
      against her temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wynnie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;our friends are not drowned. I think you will see them
      quite safe in the morning. Pray to God for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave her with me,&rdquo; said Ethelwyn, proceeding to undress her; &ldquo;and tell
      nurse to bring up the large bath. There is plenty of hot water in the
      boiler. I gave orders to that effect, not knowing what might happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie shuddered as her mother said this; but I waited no longer, for when
      Ethelwyn spoke everyone felt her authority. I obeyed her, and then went to
      Connie&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind being left alone a little while?&rdquo; I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa; only&mdash;are they all drowned?&rdquo; she said with a shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, my dear; but be sure of the mercy of God, whatever you fear.
      You must rest in him, my love; for he is life, and will conquer death both
      in the soul and in the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of myself, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, my dear. But God is thinking of you and every creature that
      he has made. And for our sakes you must be quiet in heart, that you may
      get better, and be able to help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try, papa,&rdquo; she said; and, turning slowly on her side, she lay
      quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora and the boys were all fast asleep, for it was very late. I cannot,
      however, say what hour it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Telling nurse to be on the watch because Connie was alone, I went again to
      the beach. I called first, however, to inquire after Agnes. I found her
      quite composed, sitting with her parents by the fire, none of them doing
      anything, scarcely speaking, only listening intently to the sounds of the
      storm now beginning to die away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I next went to the place where I had left Turner. Five bodies lay there,
      and he was busy with a sixth. The surgeon of the place was with him, and
      they quite expected to recover this man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then went down to the sands. An officer of the revenue was taking charge
      of all that came ashore&mdash;chests, and bales, and everything. For a
      week the sea went on casting out the fragments of that which she had
      destroyed. I have heard that, for years after, the shifting of the sands
      would now and then discover things buried that night by the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the next day the bodies kept coming ashore, some peaceful as in sleep,
      others broken and mutilated. Many were cast upon other parts of the coast.
      Some four or five only, all men, were recovered. It was strange to me how
      I got used to it. The first horror over, the cry that yet another body had
      come awoke only a gentle pity&mdash;no more dismay or shuddering. But,
      finding I could be of no use, I did not wait longer than just till the
      morning began to dawn with a pale ghastly light over the seething raging
      sea; for the sea raged on, although the wind had gone down. There were
      many strong men about, with two surgeons and all the coastguard, who were
      well accustomed to similar though not such extensive destruction. The
      houses along the shore were at the disposal of any who wanted aid; the
      Parsonage was at some distance; and I confess that when I thought of the
      state of my daughters, as well as remembered former influences upon my
      wife, I was very glad to think there was no necessity for carrying thither
      any of those whom the waves cast on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached home, and found Wynnie quieter and Connie again asleep, I
      walked out along our own downs till I came whence I could see the little
      schooner still safe at anchor. From her position I concluded&mdash;correctly
      as I found afterwards&mdash;that they had let out her cable far enough to
      allow her to reach the bed of the little stream, where the tide would
      leave her more gently. She was clearly out of all danger now; and if
      Percivale and Joe had got safe on board of her, we might confidently
      expect to see them before many hours were passed. I went home with the
      good news.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments I doubted whether I should tell Wynnie, for I could not
      know with any certainty that Percivale was in the schooner. But presently
      I recalled former conclusions to the effect that we have no right to
      modify God&rsquo;s facts for fear of what may be to come. A little hope founded
      on a present appearance, even if that hope should never be realised, may
      be the very means of enabling a soul to bear the weight of a sorrow past
      the point at which it would otherwise break down. I would therefore tell
      Wynnie, and let her share my expectation of deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think she had been half-asleep, for when I entered her room she started
      up in a sitting posture, looking wild, and putting her hands to her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought you good news, Wynnie,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have been out on the
      downs, and there is light enough now to see that the little schooner is
      quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What schooner?&rdquo; she asked listlessly, and lay down again, her eyes still
      staring, awfully unappeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the schooner they say Percivale got on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t drowned then!&rdquo; she cried with a choking voice, and put her hands
      to her face and burst into tears and sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wynnie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;look what your faithlessness brings upon you. Everybody
      but you has known all night that Percivale and Joe Harper are probably
      quite safe. They may be ashore in a couple of hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know it. He may be drowned yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there is room for doubt, but none for despair. See what a poor
      helpless creature hopelessness makes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I help it, papa?&rdquo; she asked piteously. &ldquo;I am made so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as she spoke the dawn was clear upon the height of her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not made yet, as I am always telling you; and God has ordained
      that you shall have a hand in your own making. You have to consent, to
      desire that what you know for a fault shall be set right by his loving
      will and spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know God, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear, that is where it all lies. You do not know him, or you would
      never be without hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do to know him!&rdquo; she asked, rising on her elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saving power of hope was already working in her. She was once more
      turning her face towards the Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read as you have never read before about Christ Jesus, my love. Read with
      the express object of finding out what God is like, that you may know him
      and may trust him. And now give yourself to him, and he will give you
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do,&rdquo; I said to my wife, &ldquo;if Percivale continue silent? For
      even if he be in love with her, I doubt if he will speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must leave all that, Harry,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was turning on myself the counsel I had been giving Wynnie. It is
      strange how easily we can tell our brother what he ought to do, and yet,
      when the case comes to be our own, do precisely as we had rebuked him for
      doing. I lay down and fell fast asleep.

      CHAPTER IX. THE FUNERAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a lovely morning when I woke once more. The sun was flashing back
      from the sea, which was still tossing, but no longer furiously, only as if
      it wanted to turn itself every way to flash the sunlight about. The
      madness of the night was over and gone; the light was abroad, and the
      world was rejoicing. When I reached the drawing-room, which afforded the
      best outlook over the shore, there was the schooner lying dry on the
      sands, her two cables and anchors stretching out yards behind her; but
      half way between the two sides of the bay rose a mass of something
      shapeless, drifted over with sand. It was all that remained together of
      the great ship that had the day before swept over the waters like a live
      thing with wings&mdash;of all the works of man&rsquo;s hands the nearest to the
      shape and sign of life. The wind had ceased altogether, only now and then
      a little breeze arose which murmured &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; and lay down
      again. And I knew that in the houses on the shore dead men and women were
      lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to the dining-room. The three children were busy at their
      breakfast, but neither wife, daughter, nor visitor had yet appeared. I
      made a hurried meal, and was just rising to go and inquire further into
      the events of the night, when the door opened, and in walked Percivale,
      looking very solemn, but in perfect health and well-being. I grasped his
      hand warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you are returned to us, Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if that is much to give thanks for,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are the judges of that,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;Tell me all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was narrating the events I have already communicated, Wynnie
      entered. She started, turned pale and then very red, and for a moment
      hesitated in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is another to rejoice at your safety, Percivale,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he stepped forward to meet her, and she gave him her hand with
      an emotion so evident that I felt a little distressed&mdash;why, I could
      not easily have told, for she looked most charming in the act,&mdash;more
      lovely than I had ever seen her. Her beauty was unconsciously praising
      God, and her heart would soon praise him too. But Percivale was a modest
      man, and I think attributed her emotion to the fact that he had been in
      danger in the way of duty,&mdash;a fact sufficient to move the heart of
      any good woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and began to busy herself with the teapot. Her hand trembled.
      I requested Percivale to begin his story once more; and he evidently
      enjoyed recounting to her the adventures of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him to sit down and have a second breakfast while I went into the
      village, whereto he seemed nothing loth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I crossed the floor of the old mill to see how Joe was, the head of the
      sexton appeared emerging from it. He looked full of weighty solemn
      business. Bidding me good-morning, he turned to the corner where his tools
      lay, and proceeded to shoulder spade and pickaxe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Coombes! you&rsquo;ll want them,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many o&rsquo; my people be come all at once, you see, sir,&rdquo; he returned.
      &ldquo;I shall have enough ado to make &lsquo;em all comfortable like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must get help, you know; you can never make them all comfortable
      yourself alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what I can do,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I ben&rsquo;t a bit willin&rsquo; to let no
      one do my work for me, I do assure you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many are there wanting your services?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be fifteen of them now, and there be more, I don&rsquo;t doubt, on the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t think of making separate graves for them all,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;They died together: let them lie together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man set down his tools, and looked me in the face with
      indignation. The face was so honest and old, that, without feeling I had
      deserved it, I yet felt the rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like, sir,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;to be put in the same bed
      with a lot of people you didn&rsquo;t know nothing about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew the old man&rsquo;s way, and that any argument which denied the premiss
      of his peculiar fancy was worse than thrown away upon him. I therefore
      ventured no farther than to say that I had heard death was a leveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be very true; and, mayhap, they mightn&rsquo;t think of it after they&rsquo;d
      been down awhile&mdash;six weeks, mayhap, or so. But anyhow, it can&rsquo;t be
      comfortable for &lsquo;em, poor things. One on &lsquo;em be a baby: I daresay he&rsquo;d
      rather lie with his mother. The doctor he say one o&rsquo; the women be a
      mother. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he went on reflectively, &ldquo;whether she be the baby&rsquo;s
      own mother, but I daresay neither o&rsquo; them &lsquo;ll mind it if I take it for
      granted, and lay &lsquo;em down together. So that&rsquo;s one bed less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One thing was clear, that the old man could not dig fourteen graves within
      the needful time. But I would not interfere with his office in the church,
      having no reason to doubt that he would perform its duties to perfection.
      He shouldered his tools again and walked out. I descended the stair,
      thinking to see Joe; but there was no one there but the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are Joe and Agnes?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir, Joe had promised a little job of work to be ready to-day,
      and so he couldn&rsquo;t stop. He did say Agnes needn&rsquo;t go with him; but she
      thought she couldn&rsquo;t part with him so soon, you see, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had received him from the dead&mdash;raised to life again,&rdquo; I said;
      &ldquo;it was most natural. But what a fine fellow Joe is; nothing will make him
      neglect his work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to get him to stop, sir, saying he had done quite enough last
      night for all next day; but he told me it was his business to get the tire
      put on Farmer Wheatstone&rsquo;s cart-wheel to-day just as much as it was his
      business to go in the life-boat yesterday. So he would go, and Aggy
      wouldn&rsquo;t stay behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine fellow, Joe!&rdquo; I said, and took my leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I drew near the village, I heard the sound of hammering and sawing, and
      apparently everything at once in the way of joinery; they were making the
      coffins in the joiners&rsquo; shops, of which there were two in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not like coffins. They seem to me relics of barbarism. If I had my
      way, I would have the old thing decently wound in a fair linen cloth, and
      so laid in the bosom of the earth, whence it was taken. I would have it
      vanish, not merely from the world of vision, but from the world of form,
      as soon as may be. The embrace of the fine life-hoarding, life-giving
      mould, seems to me comforting, in the vague, foolish fancy that will
      sometimes emerge from the froth of reverie&mdash;I mean, of subdued
      consciousness remaining in the outworn frame. But the coffin is altogether
      and vilely repellent. Of this, however, enough, I hate even the shadow of
      sentiment, though some of my readers, who may not yet have learned to
      distinguish between sentiment and feeling, may wonder how I dare to utter
      such a barbarism.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the house of the county magistrate hard by, for I thought
      something might have to be done in which I had a share. I found that he
      had sent a notice of the loss of the vessel to the Liverpool papers,
      requesting those who might wish to identify or claim any of the bodies to
      appear within four days at Kilkhaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      This threw the last upon Saturday, and before the end of the week it was
      clear that they must not remain above ground over Sunday. I therefore
      arranged that they should be buried late on the Saturday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Friday morning, a young woman and an old man, unknown to each
      other, arrived by the coach from Barnstaple. They had come to see the last
      of their friends in this world; to look, if they might, at the shadow left
      behind by the departing soul. For as the shadow of any object remains a
      moment upon the magic curtain of the eye after the object itself has gone,
      so the shadow of the soul, namely, the body, lingers a moment upon the
      earth after the object itself has gone to the &ldquo;high countries.&rdquo; It was
      well to see with what a sober sorrow the dignified little old man bore his
      grief. It was as if he felt that the loss of his son was only for a
      moment. But the young woman had taken on the hue of the corpse she came to
      seek. Her eyes were sunken as if with the weight of the light she cared
      not for, and her cheeks had already pined away as if to be ready for the
      grave. A being thus emptied of its glory seized and possessed my thoughts.
      She never even told us whom she came seeking, and after one involuntary
      question, which simply received no answer, I was very careful not even to
      approach another. I do not think the form she sought was there; and she
      may have gone home with the lingering hope to cast the gray aurora of a
      doubtful dawn over her coming days, that, after all, that one had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Friday afternoon, with the approbation of the magistrate, I had all
      the bodies removed to the church. Some in their coffins, others on
      stretchers, they were laid in front of the communion-rail. In the evening
      these two went to see them. I took care to be present. The old man soon
      found his son. I was at his elbow as he walked between the rows of the
      dead. He turned to me and said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, sir. He was a good lad. God rest his soul. He&rsquo;s with his
      mother; and if I&rsquo;m sorry, she&rsquo;s glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he smiled, or tried to smile. I could only lay my hand on his
      arm, to let him know that I understood him, and was with him. He walked
      out of the church, sat down, upon a stone, and stared at the mould of a
      new-made grave in front of him. What was passing behind those eyes God
      only knew&mdash;certainly the man himself did not know. Our lightest
      thoughts are of more awful significance than the most serious of us can
      imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the young woman, I thought she left the church with a little light in
      her eyes; but she had said nothing. Alas! that the body was not there
      could no more justify her than Milton in letting her
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;frail thoughts dally with false surmise.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      With him, too, she might well add&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas Wash far away.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But God had them in his teaching, and all I could do was to ask them to be
      my guests till the funeral and the following Sunday were over. To this
      they kindly consented, and I took them to my wife, who received them like
      herself, and had in a few minutes made them at home with her, to which no
      doubt their sorrow tended, for that brings out the relations of humanity
      and destroys its distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning a Scotchman of a very decided type, originally from
      Aberdeen, but resident in Liverpool, appeared, seeking the form of his
      daughter. I had arranged that whoever came should be brought to me first.
      I went with him to the church. He was a tall, gaunt, bony man, with long
      arms and huge hands, a rugged granite-like face, and a slow ponderous
      utterance, which I had some difficulty in understanding. He treated the
      object of his visit with a certain hardness, and at the same time
      lightness, which also I had some difficulty in understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see the&mdash;&rdquo; I said, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow ay&mdash;the boadies,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She winna be there, I daursay,
      but I wad jist like to see; for I wadna like her to be beeried gin sae be
      &lsquo;at she was there, wi&rsquo;oot biddin&rsquo; her good-bye like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the church, I opened the door and entered. An awe fell
      upon me fresh and new. The beautiful church had become a tomb: solemn,
      grand, ancient, it rose as a memorial of the dead who lay in peace before
      her altar-rail, as if they had fled thither for sanctuary from a sea of
      troubles. And I thought with myself, Will the time ever come when the
      churches shall stand as the tombs of holy things that have passed away,
      when Christ shall have rendered up the kingdom to his Father, and no man
      shall need to teach his neighbour or his brother, saying, &ldquo;Know the Lord&rdquo;?
      The thought passed through my mind and vanished, as I led my companion up
      to the dead. He glanced at one and another, and passed on. He had looked
      at ten or twelve ere he stopped, gazing on the face of the beautiful form
      which had first come ashore. He stooped and stroked the white cheeks,
      taking the head in his great rough hands, and smoothed the brown hair
      tenderly, saying, as if he had quite forgotten that she was dead&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Maggie! hoo cam <i>ye</i> here, lass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if for the first time the reality had grown comprehensible, he
      put his hands before his face, and burst into tears. His huge frame was
      shaken with sobs for one long minute, while I stood looking on with awe
      and reverence. He ceased suddenly, pulled a blue cotton handkerchief with
      yellow spots on it&mdash;I see it now&mdash;from his pocket, rubbed his
      face with it as if drying it with a towel, put it back, turned, and said,
      without looking at me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll awa&rsquo; hame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like a piece of her hair?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gin ye please,&rdquo; he answered gently, as if his daughter&rsquo;s form had been
      mine now, and her hair were mine to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the vestry door sat Mrs. Coombes, watching the dead, with her sweet
      solemn smile, and her constant ministration of knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got a pair of scissors there, Mrs. Coombes?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, sir,&rdquo; she answered, rising, and lifting a huge pair by
      the string suspending them from her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut off a nice piece of this beautiful hair,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted the lovely head, chose, and cut off a long piece, and handed it
      respectfully to the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it without a word, sat down on the step before the communion-rail,
      and began to smooth out the wonderful sleave of dusky gold. It was,
      indeed, beautiful hair. As he drew it out, I thought it must be a yard
      long. He passed his big fingers through and through it, but tenderly, as
      if it had been still growing on the live lovely head, stopping every
      moment to pick out the bits of sea-weed and shells, and shake out the sand
      that had been wrought into its mass. He sat thus for nearly half-an-hour,
      and we stood looking on with something closely akin to awe. At length he
      folded it up, drew from his pocket an old black leather book, laid it
      carefully in the innermost pocket, and rose. I led the way from the
      church, and he followed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the church, he laid his hand on my arm, and said, groping with his
      other hand in his trousers-pocket&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll hae putten ye to some expense&mdash;for the coffin an&rsquo; sic like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that afterwards,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Come home with me now,
      and have some refreshment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, I thank ye. I hae putten ye to eneuch o&rsquo; tribble already. I&rsquo;ll jist
      awa&rsquo; hame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to lay them down this evening. You won&rsquo;t go before the
      funeral. Indeed, I think you can&rsquo;t get away till Monday morning. My wife
      and I will be glad of your company till then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no company for gentle-fowk, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and show me in which of these graves you would like to have her
      laid,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He yielded and followed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coombes had not dug many spadefuls before he saw what had been plain
      enough&mdash;that ten such men as he could not dig the graves in time. But
      there was plenty of help to be had from the village and the neighbouring
      farms. Most of them were now ready, but a good many men were still at
      work. The brown hillocks lay all about the church-yard&mdash;the
      mole-heaps of burrowing Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked around him. His face grew critical. He stepped a
      little hither and thither. At length he turned to me and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wadna like to be greedy; but gin ye wad lat her lie next the kirk there&mdash;i&rsquo; 
      that neuk, I wad tak&rsquo; it kindly. And syne gin ever it cam&rsquo; aboot that I
      cam&rsquo; here again, I wad ken whaur she was. Could ye get a sma&rsquo; bit
      heidstane putten up? I wad leave the siller wi&rsquo; ye to pay for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I can. What will you have put on the stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow jist&mdash;let me see&mdash;Maggie Jamieson&mdash;nae Marget, but jist
      Maggie. She was aye Maggie at home. Maggie Jamieson, frae her father. It&rsquo;s
      the last thing I can gie her. Maybe ye micht put a verse o&rsquo; Scripter
      aneath&rsquo;t, ye ken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What verse would you like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought for a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isna there a text that says, &lsquo;The deid shall hear his voice&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: &lsquo;The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. That&rsquo;s it. Weel, jist put that on.&mdash;They canna do better than
      hear his voice,&rdquo; he added, with a strange mixture of Scotch ratiocination.
    </p>
    <p>
      I led the way home, and he accompanied me without further objection or
      apology. After dinner, I proposed that we should go upon the downs, for
      the day was warm and bright. We sat on the grass. I felt that I could not
      talk to them as from myself. I knew nothing of the possible gulfs of
      sorrow in their hearts. To me their forms seemed each like a hill in whose
      unseen bosom lay a cavern of dripping waters, perhaps with a subterranean
      torrent of anguish raving through its hollows and tumbling down hidden
      precipices, whose voice God only heard, and God only could still. This
      daughter <i>might</i>, though from her face I did not think it, have gone
      away against her father&rsquo;s will. That son <i>might</i> have been a
      ne&rsquo;er-do-well at home&mdash;how could I tell? The woman <i>might</i> be
      looking for the lover that had forsaken her&mdash;I could not divine. I
      would speak no words of my own. The Son of God had spoken words of comfort
      to his mourning friends, when he was the present God and they were the
      forefront of humanity; I would read some of the words he spoke. From them
      the human nature in each would draw what comfort it could. I took my New
      Testament from my pocket, and said, without any preamble,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When our Lord was going to die, he knew that his friends loved him enough
      to be very wretched about it. He knew that they would be overwhelmed for a
      time with trouble. He knew, too, that they could not believe the glad end
      of it all, to which end he looked, across the awful death that awaited him&mdash;a
      death to which that of our friends in the wreck was ease itself. I will
      just read to you what he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read from the fourteenth to the seventeenth chapter of St. John&rsquo;s
      Gospel. I knew there were worlds of meaning in the words into which I
      could hardly hope any of them would enter. But I knew likewise that the
      best things are just those from which the humble will draw the truth they
      are capable of seeing. Therefore I read as for myself, and left it to them
      to hear for themselves. Nor did I add any word of comment, fearful of
      darkening counsel by words without knowledge. For the Bible is awfully set
      against what is not wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished, I closed the book, rose from the grass, and walked
      towards the brow of the shore. They rose likewise and followed me. I
      talked of slight things; the tone was all that communicated between us.
      But little of any sort was said. The sea lay still before us, knowing
      nothing of the sorrow it had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wandered a little way along the cliff. The burial-service was at seven
      o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have an invalid to visit out in this direction,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;would you
      mind walking with me? I shall not stay more than five minutes, and we
      shall get back just in time for tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They assented kindly. I walked first with one, then with another; heard a
      little of the story of each; was able to say a few words of sympathy, and
      point, as it were, a few times towards the hills whence cometh our aid. I
      may just mention here, that since our return to Marshmallows I have had
      two of them, the young woman and the Scotchman, to visit us there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell began to toll, and we went to church. My companions placed
      themselves near the dead. I went into the vestry till the appointed hour.
      I thought as I put on my surplice how, in all religions but the Christian,
      the dead body was a pollution to the temple. Here the church received it,
      as a holy thing, for a last embrace ere it went to the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dead were already in the church, the usual form could not be
      carried out. I therefore stood by the communion-table, and there began to
      read, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that
      believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
      liveth and believeth in me shall never die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I advanced, as I read, till I came outside the rails and stood before the
      dead. There I read the Psalm, &ldquo;Lord, thou hast been our refuge,&rdquo; and the
      glorious lesson, &ldquo;Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
      first-fruits of them that slept.&rdquo; Then the men of the neighbourhood came
      forward, and in long solemn procession bore the bodies out of the church,
      each to its grave. At the church-door I stood and read, &ldquo;Man that is born
      of a woman;&rdquo; then went from one to another of the graves, and read over
      each, as the earth fell on the coffin-lid, &ldquo;Forasmuch as it hath pleased
      Almighty God, of his great mercy.&rdquo; Then again, I went back to the
      church-door and read, &ldquo;I heard a voice from heaven;&rdquo; and so to the end of
      the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the men to fill up the graves, I hastened to lay aside my
      canonicals, that I might join my guests; but my wife and daughter had
      already prevailed on them to leave the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word now concerning my own family. Turner insisted on Connie&rsquo;s remaining
      in bed for two or three days. She looked worse in face&mdash;pale and
      worn; but it was clear, from the way she moved in bed, that the fresh
      power called forth by the shock had not vanished with the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie was quieter almost than ever; but there was a constant <i>secret</i>
      light, if I may use the paradox, in her eyes. Percivale was at the house
      every day, always ready to make himself useful. My wife bore up
      wonderfully. As yet the much greater catastrophe had come far short of the
      impression made by the less. When quieter hours should come, however, I
      could not help fearing that the place would be dreadfully painful to all
      but the younger ones, who, of course, had the usual child-gift of
      forgetting. The servants&mdash;even Walter&mdash;looked thin and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Saturday night I found myself, as I had once or twice found myself
      before, entirely unprepared to preach. I did not feel anxious, because I
      did not feel that I was to blame: I had been so much occupied. I had again
      and again turned my thoughts thitherward, but nothing recommended itself
      to me so that I could say &ldquo;I must take that;&rdquo; nothing said plainly, &ldquo;This
      is what you have to speak of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As often as I had sought to find fitting matter for my sermon, my mind had
      turned to death and the grave; but I shrunk from every suggestion, or
      rather nothing had come to me that interested myself enough to justify me
      in giving it to my people. And I always took it as my sole justification,
      in speaking of anything to the flock of Christ, that I cared heartily in
      my own soul for that thing. Without this consciousness I was dumb. And I
      do think, highly as I value prophecy, that a clergyman ought to be at
      liberty upon occasion to say, &ldquo;My friends, I cannot preach to-day.&rdquo; What a
      riddance it would be for the Church, I do not say if every priest were to
      speak sense, but only if every priest were to abstain from speaking of
      that in which, at the moment, he feels little or no interest!
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to bed, which is often the very best thing a man can do; for sleep
      will bring him from God that which no effort of his own will can compass.
      I have read somewhere&mdash;I will verify it by present search&mdash;that
      Luther&rsquo;s translation, of the verse in the psalm, &ldquo;So he giveth to his
      beloved sleep,&rdquo; is, &ldquo;He giveth his beloved sleeping,&rdquo; or while asleep.
      Yes, so it is, literally, in English, &ldquo;It is in vain that ye rise early,
      and then sit long, and eat your bread with care, for to his friends he
      gives it sleeping.&rdquo; This was my experience in the present instance; for
      the thought of which I was first conscious when I awoke was, &ldquo;Why should I
      talk about death? Every man&rsquo;s heart is now full of death. We have enough
      of that&mdash;even the sum that God has sent us on the wings of the
      tempest. What I have to do, as the minister of the new covenant, is to
      speak of life.&rdquo; It flashed in on my mind: &ldquo;Death is over and gone. The
      resurrection comes next. I will speak of the raising of Lazarus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same moment I knew that I was ready to speak. Shall I or shall I not
      give my reader the substance of what I said? I wish I knew how many of
      them would like it, and how many would not. I do not want to bore them
      with sermons, especially seeing I have always said that no sermons ought
      to be printed; for in print they are but what the old alchymists would
      have called a <i>caput mortuum</i>, or death&rsquo;s head, namely, a lifeless
      lump of residuum at the bottom of the crucible; for they have no longer
      the living human utterance which gives all the power on the minds of the
      hearers. But I have not, either in this or in my preceding narrative,
      attempted to give a sermon as I preached it. I have only sought to present
      the substance of it in a form fitter for being read, somewhat cleared of
      the unavoidable, let me say necessary&mdash;yes, I will say <i>valuable</i>&mdash;repetitions
      and enforcements by which the various considerations are pressed upon the
      minds of the hearers. These are entirely wearisome in print&mdash;useless
      too, for the reader may ponder over every phrase till he finds out the
      purport of it&mdash;if indeed there be such readers nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose, went down to the bath in the rocks, had a joyous physical
      ablution, and a swim up and down the narrow cleft, from which I emerged as
      if myself newly born or raised anew, and then wandered about on the downs
      full of hope and thankfulness, seeking all I could to plant deep in my
      mind the long-rooted truths of resurrection, that they might be not only
      ready to blossom in the warmth of the spring-tides to come, but able to
      send out some leaves and promissory buds even in the wintry time of the
      soul, when the fogs of pain steam up from the frozen clay soil of the
      body, and make the monarch-will totter dizzily upon his throne, to comfort
      the eyes of the bewildered king, reminding him that the King of kings hath
      conquered Death and the Grave. There is no perfect faith that cannot laugh
      at winters and graveyards, and all the whole array of defiant appearances.
      The fresh breeze of the morning visited me. &ldquo;O God,&rdquo; I said in my heart,
      &ldquo;would that when the dark day comes, in which I can feel nothing, I may be
      able to front it with the memory of this day&rsquo;s strength, and so help
      myself to trust in the Father! I would call to mind the days of old, with
      David the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the house, I found that one of the sailors, who had
      been cast ashore with his leg broken, wished to see me. I obeyed, and
      found him very pale and worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am going, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I wanted to see you before I
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust in Christ, and do not be afraid,&rdquo; I returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prayed to him to save me when I was hanging to the rigging, and if I
      wasn&rsquo;t afraid then, I&rsquo;m not going to be afraid now, dying quietly in my
      bed. But just look here, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took from under his pillow something wrapped up in paper, unfolded the
      envelope, and showed a lump of something&mdash;I could not at first tell
      what. He put it in my hand, and then I saw that it was part of a bible,
      with nearly the upper half of it worn or cut away, and the rest partly in
      a state of pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the bible my mother gave me when I left home first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know how I came to put it in my pocket, but I think the rope that
      cut through that when I was lashed to the shrouds would a&rsquo;most have cut
      through my ribs if it hadn&rsquo;t been for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;The body of the Bible has saved your bodily
      life: may the spirit of it save your spiritual life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know what you mean, sir,&rdquo; he panted out. &ldquo;My mother was a good
      woman, and I know she prayed to God for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like us to pray for you in church to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir; me and Bob Fox. He&rsquo;s nearly as bad as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t forget you,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I will come in after church and see how
      you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knelt and offered the prayers for the sick, and then took my leave. I
      did not think the poor fellow was going to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may as well mention here, that he has been in my service ever since. We
      took him with us to Marshmallows, where he works in the garden and
      stables, and is very useful. We have to look after him though, for his
      health continues delicate.

      CHAPTER X. THE SERMON.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I stood up to preach, I gave them no text; but, with the eleventh
      chapter of the Gospel of St. John open before me, to keep me correct, I
      proceeded to tell the story in the words God gave me; for who can dare to
      say that he makes his own commonest speech?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and therefore our elder brother, was
      going about on the earth, eating and drinking with his brothers and
      sisters, there was one family he loved especially&mdash;a family of two
      sisters and a brother; for, although he loves everybody as much as they
      can be loved, there are some who can be loved more than others. Only God
      is always trying to make us such that we can be loved more and more. There
      are several stories&mdash;O, such lovely stories!&mdash;about that family
      and Jesus; and we have to do with one of them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lived near the capital of the country, Jerusalem, in a village they
      called Bethany; and it must have been a great relief to our Lord, when he
      was worn out with the obstinacy and pride of the great men of the city, to
      go out to the quiet little town and into the refuge of Lazarus&rsquo;s house,
      where everyone was more glad at the sound of his feet than at any news
      that could come to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had at this time behaved so ill to him in Jerusalem&mdash;taking up
      stones to stone him even, though they dared not quite do it, mad with
      anger as they were&mdash;and all because he told them the truth&mdash;that
      he had gone away to the other side of the great river that divided the
      country, and taught the people in that quiet place. While he was there his
      friend Lazarus was taken ill; and the two sisters, Martha and Mary, sent a
      messenger to him, to say to him, &lsquo;Lord, your friend is very ill.&rsquo; Only
      they said it more beautifully than that: &lsquo;Lord, behold, he whom thou
      lovest is sick.&rsquo; You know, when anyone is ill, we always want the person
      whom he loves most to come to him. This is very wonderful. In the worst
      things that can come to us the first thought is of love. People, like the
      Scribes and Pharisees, might say, &lsquo;What good can that do him?&rsquo; And we may
      not in the least suppose that the person we want knows any secret that can
      cure his pain; yet love is the first thing we think of. And here we are
      more right than we know; for, at the long last, love will cure everything:
      which truth, indeed, this story will set forth to us. No doubt the heart
      of Lazarus, ill as he was, longed after his friend; and, very likely, even
      the sight of Jesus might have given him such strength that the life in him
      could have driven out the death which had already got one foot across the
      threshold. But the sisters expected more than this: they believed that
      Jesus, whom they knew to have driven disease and death out of so many
      hearts, had only to come and touch him&mdash;nay, only to speak a word, to
      look at him, and their brother was saved. Do you think they presumed in
      thus expecting? The fact was, they did not believe enough; they had not
      yet learned to believe that he could cure him all the same whether he came
      to them or not, because he was always with them. We cannot understand
      this; but our understanding is never a measure of what is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether Jesus knew exactly all that was going to take place I cannot
      tell. Some people may feel certain upon points that I dare not feel
      certain upon. One thing I am sure of: that he did not always know
      everything beforehand, for he said so himself. It is infinitely more
      valuable to us, because more beautiful and godlike in him, that he should
      trust his Father than that he should foresee everything. At all events he
      knew that his Father did not want him to go to his friends yet. So he sent
      them a message to the effect that there was a particular reason for this
      sickness&mdash;that the end of it was not the death of Lazarus, but the
      glory of God. This, I think, he told them by the same messenger they sent
      to him; and then, instead of going to them, he remained where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But O, my friends, what shall I say about this wonderful message? Think
      of being sick for the glory of God! of being shipwrecked for the glory of
      God! of being drowned for the glory of God! How can the sickness, the
      fear, the broken-heartedness of his creatures be for the glory of God?
      What kind of a God can that be? Why just a God so perfectly, absolutely
      good, that the things that look least like it are only the means of
      clearing our eyes to let us see how good he is. For he is so good that he
      is not satisfied with <i>being</i> good. He loves his children, so that
      except he can make them good like himself, make them blessed by seeing how
      good he is, and desiring the same goodness in themselves, he is not
      satisfied. He is not like a fine proud benefactor, who is content with
      doing that which will satisfy his sense of his own glory, but like a
      mother who puts her arm round her child, and whose heart is sore till she
      can make her child see the love which is her glory. The glorification of
      the Son of God is the glorification of the human race; for the glory of
      God is the glory of man, and that glory is love. Welcome sickness, welcome
      sorrow, welcome death, revealing that glory!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next two verses sound very strangely together, and yet they almost
      seem typical of all the perplexities of God&rsquo;s dealings. The old painters
      and poets represented Faith as a beautiful woman, holding in her hand a
      cup of wine and water, with a serpent coiled up within. Highhearted Faith!
      she scruples not to drink of the life-giving wine and water; she is not
      repelled by the upcoiled serpent. The serpent she takes but for the type
      of the eternal wisdom that looks repellent because it is not understood.
      The wine is good, the water is good; and if the hand of the supreme Fate
      put that cup in her hand, the serpent itself must be good too,&mdash;harmless,
      at least, to hurt the truth of the water and the wine. But let us read the
      verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. When he had heard
      therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place
      where he was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange! his friend was sick: he abode two days where he was! But
      remember what we have already heard. The glory of God was infinitely more
      for the final cure of a dying Lazarus, who, give him all the life he could
      have, would yet, without that glory, be in death, than the mere presence
      of the Son of God. I say <i>mere</i> presence, for, compared with the
      glory of God, the very presence of his Son, so dissociated, is nothing. He
      abode where he was that the glory of God, the final cure of humanity, the
      love that triumphs over death, might shine out and redeem the hearts of
      men, so that death could not touch them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the two days, the hour had arrived. He said to his disciples, &lsquo;Let
      us go back to Judæa.&rsquo; They expostulated, because of the danger, saying,
      &lsquo;Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither
      again?&rsquo; The answer which he gave them I am not sure whether I can
      thoroughly understand; but I think, in fact I know, it must bear on the
      same region of life&mdash;the will of God. I think what he means by
      walking in the day is simply doing the will of God. That was the sole, the
      all-embracing light in which Jesus ever walked. I think he means that now
      he saw plainly what the Father wanted him to do. If he did not see that
      the Father wanted him to go back to Judæa, and yet went, that would be to
      go stumblingly, to walk in the darkness. There are twelve hours in the day&mdash;one
      time to act&mdash;a time of light and the clear call of duty; there is a
      night when a man, not seeing where or hearing how, must be content to
      rest. Something not inharmonious with this, I think, he must have
      intended; but I do not see the whole thought clearly enough to be sure
      that I am right. I do think, further, that it points at a clearer
      condition of human vision and conviction than I am good enough to
      understand; though I hope one day to rise into this upper stratum of
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether his scholars had heard anything of Lazarus yet, I do not know. It
      looks a little as if Jesus had not told them the message he had had from
      the sisters. But he told them now that he was asleep, and that he was
      going to wake him. You would think they might have understood this. The
      idea of going so many miles to wake a man might have surely suggested
      death. But the disciples were sorely perplexed with many of his words.
      Sometimes they looked far away for the meaning when the meaning lay in
      their very hearts; sometimes they looked into their hands for it when it
      was lost in the grandeur of the ages. But he meant them to see into all
      that he said by and by, although they could not see into it now. When they
      understood him better, then they would understand what he said better. And
      to understand him better they must be more like him; and to make them more
      like him he must go away and give them his spirit&mdash;awful mystery
      which no man but himself can understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now he had to tell them plainly that Lazarus was dead. They had not
      thought of death as a sleep. I suppose this was altogether a new and
      Christian idea. Do not suppose that it applied more to Lazarus than to
      other dead people. He was none the less dead that Jesus meant to take a
      weary two days&rsquo; journey to his sepulchre and wake him. If death is not a
      sleep, Jesus did not speak the truth when he said Lazarus slept. You may
      say it was a figure; but a figure that is not like the thing it figures is
      simply a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They set out to go back to Judæa. Here we have a glimpse of the faith of
      Thomas, the doubter. For a doubter is not without faith. The very fact
      that he doubts, shows that he has some faith. When I find anyone hard upon
      doubters, I always doubt the <i>quality</i> of his faith. It is of little
      use to have a great cable, if the hemp is so poor that it breaks like the
      painter of a boat. I have known people whose power of believing chiefly
      consisted in their incapacity for seeing difficulties. Of what fine sort a
      faith must be that is founded in stupidity, or far worse, in indifference
      to the truth and the mere desire to get out of hell! That is not a grand
      belief in the Son of God, the radiation of the Father. Thomas&rsquo;s want of
      faith was shown in the grumbling, self-pitying way in which he said, &lsquo;Let
      us also go that we may die with him.&rsquo; His Master had said that he was
      going to wake him. Thomas said, &lsquo;that we may die with him.&rsquo; You may say,
      &lsquo;He did not understand him.&rsquo; True, it may be, but his unbelief was the
      cause of his not understanding him. I suppose Thomas meant this as a
      reproach to Jesus for putting them all in danger by going back to Judæa;
      if not, it was only a poor piece of sentimentality. So much for Thomas&rsquo;s
      unbelief. But he had good and true faith notwithstanding; for <i>he went
      with his Master</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the time they reached the neighbourhood of Bethany, Lazarus had been
      dead four days. Someone ran to the house and told the sisters that Jesus
      was coming. Martha, as soon as she heard it, rose and went to meet him. It
      might be interesting at another time to compare the difference of the
      behaviour of the two sisters upon this occasion with the difference of
      their behaviour upon another occasion, likewise recorded; but with the man
      dead in his sepulchre, and the hope dead in these two hearts, we have no
      inclination to enter upon fine distinctions of character. Death and grief
      bring out the great family likenesses in the living as well as in the
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Martha came to Jesus, she showed her true though imperfect faith by
      almost attributing her brother&rsquo;s death to Jesus&rsquo; absence. But even in the
      moment, looking in the face of the Master, a fresh hope, a new budding of
      faith, began in her soul. She thought&mdash;&lsquo;What if, after all, he were
      to bring him to life again!&rsquo; O, trusting heart, how thou leavest the
      dull-plodding intellect behind thee! While the conceited intellect is
      reasoning upon the impossibility of the thing, the expectant faith beholds
      it accomplished. Jesus, responding instantly to her faith, granting her
      half-born prayer, says, &lsquo;Thy brother shall rise again;&rsquo; not meaning the
      general truth recognised, or at least assented to by all but the
      Sadducees, concerning the final resurrection of the dead, but meaning, &lsquo;Be
      it unto thee as thou wilt. I will raise him again.&rsquo; For there is no
      steering for a fine effect in the words of Jesus. But these words are too
      good for Martha to take them as he meant them. Her faith is not quite
      equal to the belief that he actually will do it. The thing she could hope
      for afar off she could hardly believe when it came to her very door. &lsquo;O,
      yes,&rsquo; she said, her mood falling again to the level of the commonplace,
      &lsquo;of course, at the last day.&rsquo; Then the Lord turns away her thoughts from
      the dogmas of her faith to himself, the Life, saying, &lsquo;I am the
      resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead,
      yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never
      die. Believest thou this?&rsquo; Martha, without understanding what he said more
      than in a very poor part, answered in words which preserved her honesty
      entire, and yet included all he asked, and a thousandfold more than she
      could yet believe: &lsquo;Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son
      of God, which should come into the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not pretend to have more than a grand glimmering of the truth of
      Jesus&rsquo; words &lsquo;shall never die;&rsquo; but I am pretty sure that when Martha came
      to die, she found that there was indeed no such thing as she had meant
      when she used the ghastly word <i>death</i>, and said with her first new
      breath, &lsquo;Verily, Lord, I am not dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look how this declaration of her confidence in the Christ operated
      upon herself. She instantly thought of her sister; the hope that the Lord
      would do something swelled within her, and, leaving Jesus, she went to
      find Mary. Whoever has had a true word with the elder brother, straightway
      will look around him to find his brother, his sister. The family feeling
      blossoms: he wants his friend to share the glory withal. Martha wants Mary
      to go to Jesus too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary heard her, forgot her visitors, rose, and went. They thought she
      went to the grave: she went to meet its conqueror. But when she came to
      him, the woman who had chosen the good part praised of Jesus, had but the
      same words to embody her hope and her grief that her careful and troubled
      sister had uttered a few minutes before. How often during those four days
      had not the self-same words passed between them! &lsquo;Ah, if he had been here,
      our brother had not died!&rsquo; She said so to himself now, and wept, and her
      friends who had followed her wept likewise. A moment more, and the Master
      groaned; yet a moment, and he too wept. &lsquo;Sorrow is catching;&rsquo; but this was
      not the mere infection of sorrow. It went deeper than mere sympathy; for
      he groaned in his spirit and was troubled. What made him weep? It was when
      he saw them weeping that he wept. But why should he weep, when he knew how
      soon their weeping would be turned into rejoicing? It was not for their
      weeping, so soon to be over, that he wept, but for the human heart
      everywhere swollen with tears, yea, with griefs that can find no such
      relief as tears; for these, and for all his brothers and sisters tormented
      with pain for lack of faith in his Father in heaven, Jesus wept. He saw
      the blessed well-being of Lazarus on the one side, and on the other the
      streaming eyes from whose sight he had vanished. The veil between was so
      thin! yet the sight of those eyes could not pierce it: their hearts must
      go on weeping&mdash;without cause, for his Father was so good. I think it
      was the helplessness he felt in the impossibility of at once sweeping away
      the phantasm death from their imagination that drew the tears from the
      eyes of Jesus. Certainly it was not for Lazarus; it could hardly be for
      these his friends&mdash;save as they represented the humanity which he
      would help, but could not help even as he was about to help them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jews saw herein proof that he loved Lazarus; but they little thought
      it was for them and their people, and for the Gentiles whom they despised,
      that his tears were now flowing&mdash;that the love which pressed the
      fountains of his weeping was love for every human heart, from Adam on
      through the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them went a little farther, nearly as far as the sisters, saying,
      &lsquo;Could he not have kept the man from dying?&rsquo; But it was such a poor thing,
      after all, that they thought he might have done. They regarded merely this
      unexpected illness, this early death; for I daresay Lazarus was not much
      older than Jesus. They did not think that, after all, Lazarus must die
      some time; that the beloved could be saved, at best, only for a little
      while. Jesus seems to have heard the remark, for he again groaned in
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime they were drawing near the place where he was buried. It was a
      hollow in the face of a rock, with a stone laid against it. I suppose the
      bodies were laid on something like shelves inside the rock, as they are in
      many sepulchres. They were not put into coffins, but wound round and round
      with linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they came before the door of death, Jesus said to them, &lsquo;Take away
      the stone.&rsquo; The nature of Martha&rsquo;s reply&mdash;the realism of it, as they
      would say now-a-days&mdash;would seem to indicate that her dawning faith
      had sunk again below the horizon, that in the presence of the insignia of
      death, her faith yielded, even as the faith of Peter failed him when he
      saw around him the grandeur of the high-priest, and his Master bound and
      helpless. Jesus answered&mdash;O, what an answer!&mdash;To meet the
      corruption and the stink which filled her poor human fancy, &lsquo;the glory of
      God&rsquo; came from his lips: human fear; horror speaking from the lips of a
      woman in the very jaws of the devouring death; and the &lsquo;said I not unto
      thee?&rsquo; from the mouth of him who was so soon to pass worn and bloodless
      through such a door! &lsquo;He stinketh,&rsquo; said Martha. &lsquo;The glory of God,&rsquo; said
      Jesus. &lsquo;Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou
      shouldest see the glory of God?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the open throat of the sepulchre Jesus began to speak to his
      Father aloud. He had prayed to him in his heart before, most likely while
      he groaned in his spirit. Now he thanked him that he had comforted him,
      and given him Lazarus as a first-fruit from the dead. But he will be true
      to the listening people as well as to his ever-hearing Father; therefore
      he tells why he said the word of thanks aloud&mdash;a thing not usual with
      him, for his Father was always hearing, him. Having spoken it for the
      people, he would say that it was for the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of it all was that they might believe that God had sent him&mdash;a
      far grander gift than having the dearest brought back from the grave; for
      he is the life of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Lazarus, come forth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lazarus came forth, creeping helplessly with inch-long steps of his
      linen-bound limbs. &lsquo;Ha, ha! brother, sister!&rsquo; cries the human heart. The
      Lord of Life hath taken the prey from the spoiler; he hath emptied the
      grave. Here comes the dead man, welcome as never was child from the womb&mdash;new-born,
      and in him all the human race new-born from the grave! &lsquo;Loose him and let
      him go,&rsquo; and the work is done. The sorrow is over, and the joy is come.
      Home, home, Martha, Mary, with your Lazarus! He too will go with you, the
      Lord of the Living. Home and get the feast ready, Martha! Prepare the food
      for him who comes hungry from the grave, for him who has called him
      thence. Home, Mary, to help Martha! What a household will yours be! What
      wondrous speech will pass between the dead come to life and the living
      come to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what pang is this that makes Lazarus draw hurried breath, and turns
      Martha&rsquo;s cheek so pale? Ah, at the little window of the heart the pale
      eyes of the defeated Horror look in. What! is he there still! Ah, yes, he
      will come for Martha, come for Mary, come yet again for Lazarus&mdash;yea,
      come for the Lord of Life himself, and carry all away. But look at the
      Lord: he knows all about it, and he smiles. Does Martha think of the words
      he spoke, &lsquo;He that liveth and believeth in me shall never die&rsquo;? Perhaps
      she does, and, like the moon before the sun, her face returns the smile of
      her Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, my friends, is a fancy in form, but it embodies a dear truth. What
      is it to you and me that he raised Lazarus? We are not called upon to
      believe that he will raise from the tomb that joy of our hearts which lies
      buried there beyond our sight. Stop! Are we not? We are called upon to
      believe this; else the whole story were for us a poor mockery. What is it
      to us that the Lord raised Lazarus?&mdash;Is it nothing to know that our
      Brother is Lord over the grave? Will the harvest be behind the
      first-fruits? If he tells us he cannot, for good reasons, raise up our
      vanished love to-day, or to-morrow, or for all the years of our life to
      come, shall we not mingle the smile of faithful thanks with the sorrow of
      present loss, and walk diligently waiting? That he called forth Lazarus
      showed that he was in his keeping, that he is Lord of the living, and that
      all live to him, that he has a hold of them, and can draw them forth when
      he will. If this is not true, then the raising of Lazarus is false; I do
      not mean merely false in fact, but false in meaning. If we believe in him,
      then in his name, both for ourselves and for our friends, we must deny
      death and believe in life. Lord Christ, fill our hearts with thy Life!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI. CHANGED PLANS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a day or two Connie was permitted to rise and take to her couch once
      more. It seemed strange that she should look so much worse, and yet be so
      much stronger. The growth of her power of motion was wonderful. As they
      carried her, she begged to be allowed to put her feet to the ground.
      Turner yielded, though without quite ceasing to support her. He was
      satisfied, however, that she could have stood upright for a moment at
      least. He would not, of course, risk it, and made haste to lay her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time of his departure was coming near, and he seemed more anxious the
      nearer it came; for Connie continued worn-looking and pale; and her smile,
      though ever ready to greet me when I entered, had lost much of its light.
      I noticed, too, that she had the curtain of her window constantly so
      arranged as to shut out the sea. I said something to her about it once.
      Her reply was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, I can&rsquo;t bear it. I know it is very silly; but I think I can make
      you understand how it is: I was so fond of the sea when I came down; it
      seemed to lie close to my window, with a friendly smile ready for me every
      morning when I looked out. I daresay it is all from want of faith, but I
      can&rsquo;t help it: it looks so far away now, like a friend that had failed me,
      that I would rather not see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the struggling life within her was grievously oppressed, that
      the things which surrounded her were no longer helpful. Her life had been
      driven as to its innermost cave; and now, when it had been enticed to
      venture forth and look abroad, a sudden pall had descended upon nature. I
      could not help thinking that the good of our visit to Kilkhaven had come,
      and that evil, from which I hoped we might yet escape, was following. I
      left her, and sought Turner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me, Turner,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that the sooner we get out of this the
      better for Connie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite of your opinion. I think the very prospect of leaving the
      place would do something to restore her. If she is so uncomfortable now,
      think what it will be in the many winter nights at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it would be safe to move her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far safer than to let her remain. At the worst, she is now far better
      than when she came. Try her. Hint at the possibility of going home, and
      see how she will take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t like to be left alone; but if she goes they must all go,
      except, perhaps, I might keep Wynnie. But I don&rsquo;t know how her mother
      would get on without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should stay behind. Mr. Weir would be as glad to come
      as you would be to go; and it can make no difference to Mr. Shepherd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a very sensible suggestion. I thought a moment. Certainly it was
      a desirable thing for both my sister and her husband. They had no such
      reasons as we had for disliking the place; and it would enable her to
      avoid the severity of yet another winter. I said as much to Turner, and
      went back to Connie&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of a lovely sunset was lying outside her window. She was sitting
      so that she could not see it. I would find out her feeling in the matter
      without any preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go back to Marshmallows, Connie?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her countenance flashed into light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, dear papa, do let us go,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;that would be delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think we can manage it, if you will only get a little stronger
      for the journey. The weather is not so good to travel in as when we came
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I am ever so much better, you know, than I was then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl was already stronger from the mere prospect of going home
      again. She moved restlessly on her couch, half mechanically put her hand
      to the curtain, pulled it aside, looked out, faced the sun and the sea,
      and did not draw back. My mind was made up. I left her, and went to find
      Ethelwyn. She heartily approved of the proposal for Connie&rsquo;s sake, and
      said that it would be scarcely less agreeable to herself. I could see a
      certain troubled look above her eyes, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking of Wynnie,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is hard to make one sad for the sake of the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. But it is one of the world&rsquo;s recognised necessities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, you don&rsquo;t suppose Percivale can stay here the whole winter. They
      must part some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Only they did not expect it so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here my wife was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to my study to write to Weir. I had hardly finished my letter when
      Walter came to say that Mr. Percivale wished to see me. I told him to show
      him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am just writing home to say that I want my curate to change places with
      me here, which I know he will be glad enough to do. I see Connie had
      better go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will all go, then, I presume?&rdquo; returned Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I need not so much regret that I can stay no longer. I came to tell
      you that I must leave to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Going to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you for all your kindness. You have made
      my summer something like a summer; very different, indeed, from what it
      would otherwise have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had our share of advantage, and that a large one. We are all glad
      to have made your acquaintance, Mr. Percivale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be passing through London within a week or ten days in all
      probability. Perhaps you will allow us the pleasure of looking at some of
      your pictures then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face flushed. What did the flush mean? It was not one of mere
      pleasure. There was confusion and perplexity in it. But he answered at
      once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will show you them with pleasure. I fear, however, you will not care
      for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Would this fear account for his embarrassment? I hardly thought it would;
      but I could not for a moment imagine, with his fine form and countenance
      before me, that he had any serious reason for shrinking from a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to search for a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I have your address. I shall be sure to pay you a visit. But you will
      dine with us to-day, of course?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have much pleasure,&rdquo; he answered; and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my letter to Weir, and went out for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember particularly the thoughts that moved in me and made that walk
      memorable. Indeed, I think I remember all outside events chiefly by virtue
      of the inward conditions with which they were associated. Mere outside
      things I am very ready to forget. Moods of my own mind do not so readily
      pass away; and with the memory of some of them every outward circumstance
      returns; for a man&rsquo;s life is where the kingdom of heaven is&mdash;within
      him. There are people who, if you ask the story of their lives, have
      nothing to tell you but the course of the outward events that have
      constituted, as it were, the clothes of their history. But I know, at the
      same time, that some of the most important crises in my own history (by
      which word <i>history</i> I mean my growth towards the right conditions of
      existence) have been beyond the grasp and interpretation of my intellect.
      They have passed, as it were, without my consciousness being awake enough
      to lay hold of their phenomena. The wind had been blowing; I had heard the
      sound of it, but knew not whence it came nor whither it went; only, when
      it was gone, I found myself more responsible, more eager than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember this walk from the thoughts I had about the great change
      hanging over us all. I had now arrived at the prime of middle life; and
      that change which so many would escape if they could, but which will let
      no man pass, had begun to show itself a real fact upon the horizon of the
      future. Death looks so far away to the young, that while they acknowledge
      it unavoidable, the path stretches on in such vanishing perspective before
      them, that they see no necessity for thinking about the end of it yet; and
      far would I be from saying they ought to think of it. Life is the true
      object of a man&rsquo;s care: there is no occasion to make himself think about
      death. But when the vision of the inevitable draws nigh, when it appears
      plainly on the horizon, though but as a cloud the size of a man&rsquo;s hand,
      then it is equally foolish to meet it by refusing to meet it, to answer
      the questions that will arise by declining to think about them. Indeed, it
      is a question of life then, and not of death. We want to keep fast hold of
      our life, and, in the strength of that, to look the threatening death in
      the face. But to my walk that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wandered on the downs till I came to the place where a solitary rock
      stands on the top of a cliff looking seaward, in the suggested shape of a
      monk praying. On the base on which he knelt I seated myself, and looked
      out over the Atlantic. How faded the ocean appeared! It seemed as if all
      the sunny dyes of the summer had been diluted and washed with the fogs of
      the coming winter, when I thought of the splendour it wore when first from
      these downs I gazed on the outspread infinitude of space and colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; I said to myself at length, &ldquo;has she done since then? Where is her
      work visible? She has riven, and battered, and destroyed, and her
      destruction too has passed away. So worketh Time and its powers! The
      exultation of my youth is gone; my head is gray; my wife is growing old;
      our children are pushing us from our stools; we are yielding to the new
      generation; the glory for us hath departed; our life lies weary before us
      like that sea; and the night cometh when we can no longer work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something like this was passing vaguely through my mind. I sat in a
      mournful stupor, with a half-consciousness that my mood was false, and
      that I ought to rouse myself and shake it off. There is such a thing as a
      state of moral dreaming, which closely resembles the intellectual dreaming
      in sleep. I went on in this false dreamful mood, pitying myself like a
      child tender over his hurt and nursing his own cowardice, till, all at
      once, &ldquo;a little pipling wind&rdquo; blew on my cheek. The morning was very
      still: what roused that little wind I cannot tell; but what that little
      wind roused I will try to tell. With that breath on my cheek, something
      within me began to stir. It grew, and grew, until the memory of a certain
      glorious sunset of red and green and gold and blue, which I had beheld
      from these same heights, dawned within me. I knew that the glory of my
      youth had not departed, that the very power of recalling with delight that
      which I had once felt in seeing, was proof enough of that; I knew that I
      could believe in God all the night long, even if the night were long. And
      the next moment I thought how I had been reviling in my fancy God&rsquo;s
      servant, the sea. To how many vessels had she not opened a bounteous
      highway through the waters, with labour, and food, and help, and
      ministration, glad breezes and swelling sails, healthful struggle,
      cleansing fear and sorrow, yea, and friendly death! Because she had been
      commissioned to carry this one or that one, this hundred or that thousand
      of his own creatures from one world to another, was I to revile the
      servant of a grand and gracious Master? It was blameless in Connie to feel
      the late trouble so deeply that she could not be glad: she had not had the
      experience of life, yea, of God, that I had had; she must be helped from
      without. But for me, it was shameful that I, who knew the heart of my
      Master, to whom at least he had so often shown his truth, should ever be
      doleful and oppressed. Yet even me he had now helped from within. The
      glory of existence as the child of the Infinite had again dawned upon me.
      The first hour of the evening of my life had indeed arrived; the shadows
      had begun to grow long&mdash;so long that I had begun to mark their
      length; this last little portion of my history had vanished, leaving its
      few gray ashes behind in the crucible of my life; and the final evening
      must come, when all my life would lie behind me, and all the memory of it
      return, with its mornings of gold and red, with its evenings of purple and
      green; with its dashes of storm, and its foggy glooms; with its
      white-winged aspirations, its dull-red passions, its creeping envies in
      brown and black and earthy yellow. But from all the accusations of my
      conscience, I would turn me to the Lord, for he was called Jesus because
      he should save his people from their sins. Then I thought what a grand
      gift it would be to give his people the power hereafter to fight the
      consequences of their sins. Anyhow, I would trust the Father, who loved me
      with a perfect love, to lead the soul he had made, had compelled to be,
      through the gates of the death-birth, into the light of life beyond. I
      would cast on him the care, humbly challenge him with the responsibility
      he had himself undertaken, praying only for perfect confidence in him,
      absolute submission to his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose from my seat beside the praying monk, and walked on. The thought of
      seeing my own people again filled me with gladness. I would leave those I
      had here learned to love with regret; but I trusted I had taught them
      something, and they had taught me much; therefore there could be no end to
      our relation to each other&mdash;it could not be broken, for it was <i>in
      the Lord</i>, which alone can give security to any tie. I should not,
      therefore, sorrow as if I were to see their faces no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now took my farewell of that sea and those cliffs. I should see them
      often ere we went, but I should not feel so near them again. Even this
      parting said that I must &ldquo;sit loose to the world&rdquo;&mdash;an old Puritan
      phrase, I suppose; that I could gather up only its uses, treasure its best
      things, and must let all the rest go; that those things I called mine&mdash;earth,
      sky, and sea, home, books, the treasured gifts of friends&mdash;had all to
      leave me, belong to others, and help to educate them. I should not need
      them. I should have my people, my souls, my beloved faces tenfold more,
      and could well afford to part with these. Why should I mind this chain
      passing to my eldest boy, when it was only his mother&rsquo;s hair, and I should
      have his mother still?
    </p>
    <p>
      So my thoughts went on thinking themselves, until at length I yielded
      passively to their flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Wynnie looking very grave when I went into the drawing-room. Her
      mother was there, too, and Mr. Percivale. It seemed rather a moody party.
      They wakened up a little, however, after I entered, and before dinner was
      over we were all chatting together merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Connie?&rdquo; I asked Ethelwyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderfully better already,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think everybody seems better,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;The very idea of home seems
      reviving to us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie darted a quick glance at me, caught my eyes, which was more than
      she had intended, and blushed; sought refuge in a bewildered glance at
      Percivale, caught his eye in turn, and blushed yet deeper. He plunged
      instantly into conversation, not without a certain involuntary sparkle in
      his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you go to see Mrs. Stokes this morning?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;She does not want much visiting now; she is going about
      her work, apparently in good health. Her husband says she is not like the
      same woman; and I hope he means that in more senses than one, though I do
      not choose to ask him any questions about his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did my best to keep up the conversation, but every now and then after
      this it fell like a wind that would not blow. I withdrew to my study.
      Percivale and Wynnie went out for a walk. The next morning he left by the
      coach&mdash;early. Turner went with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie did not seem very much dejected. I thought that perhaps the
      prospect of meeting him again in London kept her up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE STUDIO.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will not linger over our preparations or our leave-takings. The most
      ponderous of the former were those of the two boys, who, as they had
      wanted to bring down a chest as big as a corn-bin, full of lumber, now
      wanted to take home two or three boxes filled with pebbles, great
      oystershells, and sea-weed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weir, as I had expected, was quite pleased to make the exchange. An early
      day had been fixed for his arrival; for I thought it might be of service
      to him to be introduced to the field of his labours. Before he came, I had
      gone about among the people, explaining to them some of my reasons for
      leaving them sooner than I had intended, and telling them a little about
      my successor, that he might not appear among them quite as a stranger. He
      was much gratified with their reception of him, and had no fear of not
      finding himself quite at home with them. I promised, if I could
      comfortably manage it, to pay them a short visit the following summer, and
      as the weather was now getting quite cold, hastened our preparations for
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have wished that Turner had been with us on the journey, but he
      had been absent from his cure to the full extent that his conscience would
      permit, and I had not urged him. He would be there to receive us, and we
      had got so used to the management of Connie, that we did not feel much
      anxiety about the travelling. We resolved, if she seemed strong enough as
      we went along, to go right through to London, making a few days there the
      only break in the transit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright, cold morning when we started. But Connie could now bear
      the air so well, that we set out with the carriage open, nor had we
      occasion to close it. The first part of our railway journey was very
      pleasant. But when we drew near London, we entered a thick fog, and before
      we arrived, a small dense November rain was falling. Connie looked a
      little dispirited, partly from weariness, but no doubt from the change in
      the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very cheerful, this, Connie, my dear,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but we are going home, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Going home.</i> It set me thinking&mdash;as I had often been set
      thinking before, always with fresh discovery and a new colour on the
      dawning sky of hope. I lay back in the carriage and thought how the
      November fog this evening in London, was the valley of the shadow of death
      we had to go through on the way <i>home.</i> A. shadow like this would
      fall upon me; the world would grow dark and life grow weary; but I should
      know it was the last of the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I began to question myself wherein the idea of this home consisted. I
      knew that my soul had ever yet felt the discomfort of strangeness, more or
      less, in the midst of its greatest blessedness. I knew that as the thought
      of water to the thirsty <i>soul</i>, for it is the soul far more than the
      body that thirsts even for the material water, such is the thought of home
      to the wanderer in a strange country. As the weary soul pines for sleep,
      and every heart for the cure of its own bitterness, so my heart and soul
      had often pined for their home. Did I know, I asked myself, where or what
      that home was? It could consist in no change of place or of circumstance;
      no mere absence of care; no accumulation of repose; no blessed communion
      even with those whom my soul loved; in the midst of it all I should be
      longing for a homelier home&mdash;one into which I might enter with a
      sense of infinitely more absolute peace, than a conscious child could know
      in the arms, upon the bosom of his mother. In the closest contact of human
      soul with human soul, when all the atmosphere of thought was rosy with
      love, again and yet again on the far horizon would the dun, lurid flame of
      unrest shoot for a moment through the enchanted air, and Psyche would know
      that not yet had she reached her home. As I thought this I lifted my eyes,
      and saw those of my wife and Connie fixed on mine, as if they were
      reproaching me for saying in my soul that I could not be quite at home
      with them. Then I said in my heart, &ldquo;Come home with me, beloved&mdash;there
      is but one home for us all. When we find&mdash;in proportion as each of us
      finds&mdash;that home, shall we be gardens of delight to each other&mdash;little
      chambers of rest&mdash;galleries of pictures&mdash;wells of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again, what was this home? God himself. His thoughts, his will, his love,
      his judgment, are man&rsquo;s home. To think his thoughts, to choose his will,
      to love his loves, to judge his judgments, and thus to know that he is in
      us, with us, is to be at home. And to pass through the valley of the
      shadow of death is the way home, but only thus, that as all changes have
      hitherto led us nearer to this home, the knowledge of God, so this
      greatest of all outward changes&mdash;for it is but an outward change&mdash;will
      surely usher us into a region where there will be fresh possibilities of
      drawing nigh in heart, soul, and mind to the Father of us. It is the
      father, the mother, that make for the child his home. Indeed, I doubt if
      the home-idea is complete to the parents of a family themselves, when they
      remember that their fathers and mothers have vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point something rose in me seeking utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be delightful, wife,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;to see our fathers and mothers
      such a long way back in heaven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ethelwyn&rsquo;s face gave so little response, that I felt at once how
      dreadful a thing it was not to have had a good father or mother. I do not
      know what would have become of me but for a good father. I wonder how
      anybody ever can be good that has not had a good father. How dreadful not
      to be a good father or good mother! Every father who is not good, every
      mother who is not good, just makes it as impossible to believe in God as
      it can be made. But he is our one good Father, and does not leave us, even
      should our fathers and mothers have thus forsaken us, and left him without
      a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the evil odour of brick-burning invaded my nostrils, and I knew that
      London was about us. A few moments after, we reached the station, where a
      carriage was waiting to take us to our hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreary was the change from the stillness and sunshine of Kilkhaven to the
      fog and noise of London; but Connie slept better that night than she had
      slept for a good many nights before.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the next morning, I said to Wynnie,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to see Mr. Percivale&rsquo;s studio, my dear: have you any objection
      to going with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa,&rdquo; she answered, blushing. &ldquo;I have never seen an artist&rsquo;s studio
      in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then. Get your bonnet at once. It rains, but we shall take a
      cab, and it won&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran off, and was ready in a few minutes. We gave the driver
      directions, and set off. It was a long drive. At length he stopped at the
      door of a very common-looking house, in a very dreary-looking street, in
      which no man could possibly identify his own door except by the number. I
      knocked. A woman who looked at once dirty and cross, the former probably
      the cause of the latter, opened the door, gave a bare assent to my
      question whether Mr. Percivale was at home, withdrew to her den with the
      words &ldquo;second-floor,&rdquo; and left us to find our own way up the two flights
      of stairs. This, however, involved no great difficulty. We knocked at the
      door of the front room. A well-known voice cried, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and we
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percivale, in a short velvet coat, with his palette on his thumb, advanced
      to meet us cordially. His face wore a slight flush, which I attributed
      solely to pleasure, and nothing to any awkwardness in receiving us in such
      a poor place as he occupied. I cast my eyes round the room. Any romantic
      notions Wynnie might have indulged concerning the marvels of a studio,
      must have paled considerably at the first glance around Percivale&rsquo;s room&mdash;plainly
      the abode if not of poverty, then of self-denial, although I suspected
      both. A common room, with no carpet save a square in front of the
      fireplace; no curtains except a piece of something like drugget nailed
      flat across all the lower half of the window to make the light fall from
      upwards; two or three horsehair chairs, nearly worn out; a table in a
      corner, littered with books and papers; a horrible lay-figure, at the
      present moment dressed apparently for a scarecrow; a large easel, on which
      stood a half-finished oil-painting&mdash;these constituted almost the
      whole furniture of the room. With his pocket-handkerchief Percivale dusted
      one chair for Wynnie and another for me. Then standing before us, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a very shabby place to receive you in, Miss Walton, but it is all
      I have got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things he possesses,&rdquo;
       I ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Percivale. &ldquo;I hope not. It is well for me it should
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well for the richest man in England that it should not,&rdquo; I
      returned. &ldquo;If it were not so, the man who could eat most would be the most
      blessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are people, even of my acquaintance, however, who seem to think it
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt; but happily their thinking so will not make it so even for
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been very busy since you left us, Mr. Percivale?&rdquo; asked Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolerably,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But I have not much to show for it. That on the
      easel is all. I hardly like to let you look at it, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, because the subject is painful. Next, because it is so unfinished
      that none but a painter could do it justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should you paint subjects you would not like people to look at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I very much want people to look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not us, then?&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you do not need to be pained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it is good for you to pain anybody?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good is done by pain&mdash;is it not?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly. But whether <i>we</i> are wise enough to know when and where
      and how much, is the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do not make the pain my object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it comes only as a necessary accompaniment, that may alter the matter
      greatly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But still I am not sure that anything in which the pain
      predominates can be useful in the best way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he returned.&mdash;&ldquo;Will you look at the daub?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With much pleasure,&rdquo; I replied, and we rose and stood before the easel.
      Percivale made no remark, but left us to find out what the picture meant.
      Nor had I long to look before I understood it&mdash;in a measure at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      It represented a garret-room in a wretchedly ruinous condition. The
      plaster had come away in several places, and through between the laths in
      one spot hung the tail of a great rat. In a dark corner lay a man dying. A
      woman sat by his side, with her eyes fixed, not on his face, though she
      held his hand in hers, but on the open door, where in the gloom you could
      just see the struggles of two undertaker&rsquo;s men to get the coffin past the
      turn of the landing towards the door. Through the window there was one
      peep of the blue sky, whence a ray of sunlight fell on the one scarlet
      blossom of a geranium in a broken pot on the window-sill outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder you did not like to show it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;How can you bear
      to paint such a dreadful picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a true one. It only represents a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All facts have not a right to be represented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you would not get rid of painful things by huddling them out of
      sight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor yet by gloating upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will believe me that it gives me anything but pleasure to paint such
      pictures&mdash;as far as the subject goes,&rdquo; he said with some
      discomposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I know you well enough by this time to know that. But no one
      could hang it on his wall who would not either gloat on suffering or grow
      callous to it. Whence, then, would come the good I cannot doubt you
      propose to yourself as your object in painting the picture? If it had come
      into my possession, I would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it in the fire,&rdquo; suggested Percivale with a strange smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Still less would I sell it. I would hang it up with a curtain before
      it, and only look at it now and then, when I thought my heart was in
      danger of growing hardened to the sufferings of my fellow-men, and
      forgetting that they need the Saviour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not wish it a better fate. That would answer my end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it, now? Is it not rather those who care little or nothing about
      such matters that you would like to influence? Would you be content with
      one solitary person like me? And, remember, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it. I would
      rather not have it. I could hardly bear to know it was in my house. I am
      certain you cannot do people good by showing them <i>only</i> the painful.
      Make it as painful as you will, but put some hope into it&mdash;something
      to show that action is worth taking in the affair. From mere suffering
      people will turn away, and you cannot blame them. Every show of it,
      without hinting at some door of escape, only urges them to forget it all.
      Why should they be pained if it can do no good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of sympathy, I should say,&rdquo; answered Percivale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would rejoin, &lsquo;It is only a picture. Come along.&rsquo; No; give people
      hope, if you would have them act at all, in anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was almost hoping you would read the picture rather differently. You
      see there is a bit of blue sky up there, and a bit of sunshiny scarlet in
      the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me curiously as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can read it so for myself, and have metamorphosed its meaning so. But
      you only put in the sky and the scarlet to heighten the perplexity, and
      make the other look more terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I know that as an artist I have succeeded, however I may have failed
      otherwise. I did so mean it; but knowing you would dislike the picture, I
      almost hoped in my cowardice, as I said, that you would read your own
      meaning into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wynnie had not said a word. As I turned away from the picture, I saw that
      she was looking quite distressed, but whether by the picture or the
      freedom with which I had remarked upon it, I do not know. My eyes falling
      on a little sketch in sepia, I began to examine it, in the hope of finding
      something more pleasant to say. I perceived in a moment, however, that it
      was nearly the same thought, only treated in a gentler and more poetic
      mode. A girl lay dying on her bed. A youth held her hand. A torrent of
      summer sunshine fell through the window, and made a lake of glory upon the
      floor. I turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like that better, don&rsquo;t you, papa?&rdquo; said Wynnie tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beautiful, certainly,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And if it were only one, I
      should enjoy it&mdash;as a mood. But coming after the other, it seems but
      the same thing more weakly embodied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I confess I was a little vexed; for I had got much interested in
      Percivale, for his own sake as well as for my daughter&rsquo;s, and I had
      expected better things from him. But I saw that I had gone too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Percivale,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I have been too free in my remarks. I know, likewise, that I am a
      clergyman, and not a painter, and therefore incapable of giving the praise
      which I have little doubt your art at least deserves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust that honesty cannot offend me, however much and justly it may
      pain me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now I have said my worst, I should much like to see what else you
      have at hand to show me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately I have too much at hand. Let me see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode to the other end of the room, where several pictures were
      leaning against the wall, with their faces turned towards it. From these
      he chose one, but, before showing it, fitted it into an empty frame that
      stood beside. He then brought it forward and set it on the easel. I will
      describe it, and then my reader will understand the admiration which broke
      from me after I had regarded it for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dark hill rose against the evening sky, which shone through a few thin
      pines on its top. Along a road on the hill-side four squires bore a dying
      knight&mdash;a man past the middle age. One behind carried his helm, and
      another led his horse, whose fine head only appeared in the picture. The
      head and countenance of the knight were very noble, telling of many a
      battle, and ever for the right. The last had doubtless been gained, for
      one might read victory as well as peace in the dying look. The party had
      just reached the edge of a steep descent, from which you saw the valley
      beneath, with the last of the harvest just being reaped, while the shocks
      stood all about in the fields, under the place of the sunset. The sun had
      been down for some little time. There was no gold left in the sky, only a
      little dull saffron, but plenty of that lovely liquid green of the autumn
      sky, divided with a few streaks of pale rose. The depth of the sky
      overhead, which you could not see for the arrangement of the picture, was
      mirrored lovelily in a piece of water that lay in the centre of the
      valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;why did you not show me this first, and save
      me from saying so many unkind things? Here is a picture to my own heart;
      it is glorious. Look here, Wynnie,&rdquo; I went on; &ldquo;you see it is evening; the
      sun&rsquo;s work is done, and he has set in glory, leaving his good name behind
      him in a lovely harmony of colour. The old knight&rsquo;s work is done too; his
      day has set in the storm of battle, and he is lying lapt in the coming
      peace. They are bearing him home to his couch and his grave. Look at their
      faces in the dusky light. They are all mourning for and honouring the life
      that is ebbing away. But he is gathered to his fathers like a shock of
      corn fully ripe; and so the harvest stands golden in the valley beneath.
      The picture would not be complete, however, if it did not tell us of the
      deep heaven overhead, the symbol of that heaven whither he who has done
      his work is bound. What a lovely idea to represent it by means of the
      water, the heaven embodying itself in the earth, as it were, that we may
      see it! And observe how that dusky hill-side, and those tall slender
      mournful-looking pines, with that sorrowful sky between, lead the eye and
      point the heart upward towards that heaven. It is indeed a grand picture,
      full of feeling&mdash;a picture and a parable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Footnote: This is a description, from memory only, of a picture painted
      by Arthur Hughes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the girl. Her eyes were full of tears, either called forth by
      the picture itself or by the pleasure of finding Percivale&rsquo;s work
      appreciated by me, who had spoken so hardly of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you how glad I am that you like it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it!&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;I am simply delighted with it, more than I can
      express&mdash;so much delighted that if I could have this alongside of it,
      I should not mind hanging that other&mdash;that hopeless garret&mdash;on
      the most public wall I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Wynnie bravely, though in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;you confess&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you, papa?&mdash;that you were <i>too</i> hard on Mr. Percivale at first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too hard on his picture, my dear; and that was all he had yet given
      me to judge by. No man should paint a picture like that. You are not bound
      to disseminate hopelessness; for where there is no hope there can be no
      sense of duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely, papa, Mr. Percivale has <i>some</i> sense of duty,&rdquo; said
      Wynnie in an almost angry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly my love. Therefore I argue that he has some hope, and
      therefore, again, that he has no right to publish such a picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the word <i>publish</i> Percivale smiled. But Wynnie went on with her
      defence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see, papa, that Mr. Percivale does not paint such pictures only.
      Look at the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear. But pictures are not like poems, lying side by side in the
      same book, so that the one can counteract the other. The one of these
      might go to the stormy Hebrides, and the other to the Vale of Avalon; but
      even then I should be strongly inclined to criticise the poem, whatever
      position it stood in, that had <i>nothing</i>&mdash;positively nothing&mdash;of
      the aurora in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here let me interrupt the course of our conversation to illustrate it by a
      remark on a poem which has appeared within the last twelvemonth from the
      pen of the greatest living poet, and one who, if I may dare to judge, will
      continue the greatest for many, many years to come. It is only a little
      song, &ldquo;I stood on a tower in the wet.&rdquo; I have found few men who, whether
      from the influence of those prints which are always on the outlook for
      something to ridicule, or from some other cause, did not laugh at the
      poem. I thought and think it a lovely poem, although I am not quite sure
      of the transposition of words in the last two lines. But I do not <i>approve</i>
      of the poem, just because there is no hope in it. It lacks that touch or
      hint of <i>red</i> which is as essential, I think, to every poem as to
      every picture&mdash;the life-blood&mdash;the one pure colour. In his
      hopeful moods, let a man put on his singing robes, and chant aloud the
      words of gladness&mdash;or of grief, I care not which&mdash;to his
      fellows; in his hours of hopelessness, let him utter his thoughts only to
      his inarticulate violin, or in the evanescent sounds of any his other
      stringed instrument; let him commune with his own heart on his bed, and be
      still; let him speak to God face to face if he may&mdash;only he cannot do
      that and continue hopeless; but let him not sing aloud in such a mood into
      the hearts of his fellows, for he cannot do them much good thereby. If it
      were a fact that there is no hope, it would not be a <i>truth</i>. No
      doubt, if it were a fact, it ought to be known; but who will dare be
      confident that there is no hope? Therefore, I say, let the hopeless moods,
      at least, if not the hopeless men, be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He could refuse to let the one go without the other,&rdquo; said Wynnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are talking like a child, Wynnie, as indeed all partisans do at
      the best. He might sell them together, but the owner would part them.&mdash;If
      you will allow me, I will come and see both the pictures again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percivale assured me of welcome, and we parted, I declining to look at any
      more pictures that day, but not till we had arranged that he should dine
      with us in the evening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. HOME AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will not detain my readers with the record of the few days we spent in
      London. In writing the account of it, as in the experience of the time
      itself, I feel that I am near home, and grow the more anxious to reach it.
      Ah! I am growing a little anxious after another home, too; for the house
      of my tabernacle is falling to ruins about me. What a word <i>home</i> is!
      To think that God has made the world so that you have only to be born in a
      certain place, and live long enough in it to get at the secret of it, and
      henceforth that place is to you a <i>home</i> with all the wonderful
      meaning in the word. Thus the whole earth is a home to the race; for every
      spot of it shares in the feeling: some one of the family loves it as <i>his</i>
      home. How rich the earth seems when we so regard it&mdash;crowded with the
      loves of home! Yet I am now getting ready to <i>go home</i>&mdash;to leave
      this world of homes and go home. When I reach that home, shall I even then
      seek yet to go home? Even then, I believe, I shall seek a yet warmer,
      deeper, truer home in the deeper knowledge of God&mdash;in the truer love
      of my fellow-man. Eternity will be, my heart and my faith tell me, a
      travelling homeward, but in jubilation and confidence and the vision of
      the beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had laid Connie once more in her own room, at least the room which
      since her illness had come to be called hers, I went up to my study. The
      familiar faces of my books welcomed me. I threw myself in my
      reading-chair, and gazed around me with pleasure. I felt it so homely
      here. All my old friends&mdash;whom somehow I hoped to see some day&mdash;present
      there in the spirit ready to talk with me any moment when I was in the
      mood, making no claim upon my attention when I was not! I felt as if I
      should like, when the hour should come, to die in that chair, and pass
      into the society of the witnesses in the presence of the tokens they had
      left behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard shouts on the stair, and in rushed the two boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, papa!&rdquo; they were crying together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found the big chest just where we left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you expect it would have taken itself off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s everything in it just as we left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you afraid, then, that the moment you left it it would turn itself
      upside down, and empty itself of all its contents on the floor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed, but apparently with no very keen appreciation of the attempt
      at a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, papa, I did not think anything about it; but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;there
      everything is as we left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this triumphant answer they turned and hurried, a little abashed, out
      of the room; but not many moments elapsed before the sounds that arose
      from them were sufficiently reassuring as to the state of their spirits.
      When they were gone, I forgot my books in the attempt to penetrate and
      understand the condition of my boys&rsquo; thoughts; and I soon came to see that
      they were right and I was wrong. It was the movement of that undeveloped
      something in us which makes it possible for us in everything to give
      thanks. It was the wonder of the discovery of the existence of law. There
      was nothing that they could understand, <i>à priori</i>, to necessitate
      the remaining of the things where they had left them. No doubt there was a
      reason in the nature of God, why all things should hold together, whence
      springs the law of gravitation, as we call it; but as far as the boys
      could understand of this, all things might as well have been arranged for
      flying asunder, so that no one could expect to find anything where he had
      left it. I began to see yet further into the truth that in everything we
      must give thanks, and whatever is not of faith is sin. Even the laws of
      nature reveal the character of God, not merely as regards their ends, but
      as regards their kind, being of necessity fashioned after ideal facts of
      his own being and will.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose and went down to see if everybody was getting settled, and how the
      place looked. I found Ethel already going about the house as if she had
      never left it, and as if we all had just returned from a long absence and
      she had to show us home-hospitality. Wynnie had vanished; but I found her
      by and by in the favourite haunt of her mother before her marriage&mdash;beside
      the little pond called the Bishop&rsquo;s Basin, of which I do not think I have
      ever told my readers the legend. But why should I mention it, for I cannot
      tell it now? The frost lay thick in the hollow when I went down there to
      find her; the branches, lately clothed with leaves, stood bare and icy
      around her. Ethelwyn and I had almost forgotten that there was anything
      out of the common in connection with the house. The horror of this
      mysterious spot had laid hold upon Wynnie. I resolved that that night I
      would, in her mother&rsquo;s presence, tell her all the legend of the place, and
      the whole story of how I won her mother. I did so; and I think it made her
      trust us more. But now I left her there, and went to Connie. She lay in
      her bed; for her mother had got her thither at once, a perfect picture of
      blessed comfort. There was no occasion to be uneasy about her. I was so
      pleased to be at home again with such good hopes, that I could not rest,
      but went wandering everywhere&mdash;into places even which I had not
      entered for ten years at least, and found fresh interest in everything;
      for this was home, and here I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I fancy my readers, looking forward to the end, and seeing what a
      small amount of print is left, blaming me; some, that I have roused
      curiosity without satisfying it; others, that I have kept them so long
      over a dull book and a lame conclusion. But out of a life one cannot
      always cut complete portions, and serve them up in nice shapes. I am well
      aware that I have not told them the <i>fate</i>, as some of them would
      call it, of either of my daughters. This I cannot develop now, even as far
      as it is known to me; but, if it is any satisfaction to them to know this
      much&mdash;and it will be all that some of them mean by <i>fate</i>, I
      fear&mdash;I may as well tell them now that Wynnie has been Mrs. Percivale
      for many years, with a history well worth recounting; and that Connie has
      had a quiet, happy life for nearly as long, as Mrs. Turner. She has never
      got strong, but has very tolerable health. Her husband watches her with
      the utmost care and devotion. My Ethelwyn is still with me. Harry is gone
      home. Charlie is a barrister of the Middle Temple. And Dora&mdash;I must
      not forget Dora&mdash;well, I will say nothing about her <i>fate</i>, for
      good reasons&mdash;it is not quite determined yet. Meantime she puts up
      with the society of her old father and mother, and is something else than
      unhappy, I fully believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Connie&rsquo;s baby?&rdquo; asks some one out of ten thousand readers. I have no
      time to tell you about her now; but as you know her so little, it cannot
      be such a trial to remain, for a time at least, unenlightened with regard
      to her <i>fate.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The only other part of my history which could contain anything like
      incident enough to make it interesting in print, is a period I spent in
      London some few years after the time of which I have now been writing. But
      I am getting too old to regard the commencement of another history with
      composure. The labour of thinking into sequences, even the bodily labour
      of writing, grows more and more severe. I fancy I can think correctly
      still; but the effort necessary to express myself with corresponding
      correctness becomes, in prospect, at least, sometimes almost appalling. I
      must therefore take leave of my patient reader&mdash;for surely every one
      who has followed me through all that I have here written, well deserves
      the epithet&mdash;as if the probability that I shall write no more were a
      certainty, bidding him farewell with one word: <i>&ldquo;Friend, hope thou in
      God,&rdquo;</i> and for a parting gift offering him a new, and, I think, a true
      rendering of the first verse of the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the
      Hebrews:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now faith is the essence of hopes, the trying of things unseen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good-bye.
    </p>

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
